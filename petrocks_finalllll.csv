4, Coppola Diamond Chardonnay,United States,California,N/A,Chardonnay,Still wine,$14.99,$11.99,"
”I’ve always been influenced by the idea of Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, which was the inspiration for ultimately all modern amusements parks. I remember the beautiful theater pavilions with the curtains painted with peacock feathers that had little ballet performances. At Tivoli, there were rides, but more important than the rides were the cafes and the refreshments, and just the sense of being in a children’s garden, a ‘pleasure garden’ for all people to enjoy - which perhaps is the best phrase to describe what we’re creating here. This vision was replicated at places on Coney Island, like Luna Park, and George C. Tilyou’s Steeplechase Park, or Palisades Park. These were basically wonderlands, and I thought Francis Ford Coppola Winery could become such a park for the family to go and enjoy, where there are things for kids to do, so they can be close to their parents who are sampling wines and foods.
I’ve often felt that modern life tends to separate all the ages too much. In the old days, the children lived with the parents and the grandparents, and the family unit each gave one another something very valuable. So when we began to develop the idea for this winery, we thought it should be like a resort, basically a wine wonderland, a park of pleasure where people of all ages can enjoy the best things in life - food, wine, music, dancing, games, swimming and performances of all types. A place to celebrate the love of life.”

- Francis Ford Coppola

For more than thirty years, we have been committed to environmentally responsible business practices. It’s been our goal to minimize our impact on the environment by seeking out innovative ways to produce and package our goods.
At Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all 24 planted acres are sustainably farmed and part of the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program. We try to purchase fruit from growers who farm sustainably, and some of the vineyards we source from are certified organic as well. Another benefit of participating in the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program is that we have subsequently become a learning-teaching vineyard. Every technique we implement is thoroughly documented so that we, and neighboring Sonoma winegrowers, can pinpoint the best ways to protect our land and craft the best wines from these vineyards.
We are also actively involved in the Fish Friendly Farming certification program. While this may seem like a matter totally unrelated to wine, watershed quality management is intrinsically connected to farming our vineyard because our property includes two blue-line creeks. These creeks are a part of the Russian River watershed that supports steelhead trout and Coho salmon populations. In conjunction with our neighbors and local, state, and federal agencies, we work diligently to promote the overall health of the Russian River watershed so that the entire ecosystem remains in balance and is preserved for generations to come.
Our winegrowing practices involve the Integrated Pest Management program, which discusses the best practices for maintaining soil and vine health and proactively farming to reduce and treat pest pressures. Field experts provide monthly lectures concerning pest problems and solutions which we implement in our vineyard. Through our integrated pest management program, we have complemented the biodiversity of our vineyard by promoting the presence of beneficial insects, soil fauna, and owls that combat pests of grapevines.
Finally, we recycle our grape and water waste by fertilizing with composted grape pomace and irrigating only with reclaimed winery wastewater.  In effect, we have closed the loop on our waste system in an effort to reduce our carbon footprint on the land we so love.
Outside of the vineyard, our Francis Coppola Diamond Collection wines are packaged in 100% recycled cardboard case boxes, and all of the corks we purchase come from sustainable cork forests. Additionally, we insist that the label and foil companies we do business with have environmentally friendly practices as well.
During the reconstruction of Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all of the crews, vendors, and sub-contractors we hired were local residents, helping to cut down on transportation costs, as well as supporting the economy of our community.
Rather than use new lumber for the construction, we reused the wood from the Redwood trees that were removed from the courtyard area. Some of this timber was used to build the main reception desk in the Guest Services building, while other portions has been used to build the outdoor dining tables. The pyramid skylights in our towers feature an environmentally friendly material called Kalwall to construct skylights. This material diffuses light in such a way that little artificial lighting is needed, which helps conserve energy.

5, William Hill Chardonnay North Coast,United States,California,North Coast,Chardonnay,Still wine,$17.99,$12.99,"
William Hill Estate Winery is a special place. In 1978, visionary vineyard developer William Hill saw the incredible potential of the Silverado Bench, where he built his namesake winery. More than three decades later, our winemaker Ralf Holdenried is making modern wines that speak to the unique terroir of this virtually unknown area of southern Napa Valley.
A confluence of characteristics makes our 140-acre estate an ideal vineyard. Set on a benchland - off the valley floor, but below the steeper slopes of the hills - with a southwestern exposure, the vines bask in abundant sunlight. The vineyard is close to the valley floor climatically, but the volcanic soil and the size and vigor of the vines means William Hill is more like a mountaintop vineyard. These elements translate to elegant, expressive red Bordeaux wines.

To preserve and enhance the snappy, clean fruit flavors and acidity, winemakers carefully craft our Pinot Grigio in a reductive style, protecting the juice from oxygen exposure. We avoid malolactic fermentation, and instead ferment the grapes in stainless steel tanks at cold temperatures to retain the grapes’ natural flavors and delicate aromas. We bottle the wine early, when the fruit flavors and aromas are at their best, and use a Stelcap closure to ensure that every glass is always fresh and delicious.

14, Sycamore Lane Pinot Grigio,United States,California,N/A,Pinot Gris,Still wine,$5.99,$4.99,"
At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the world’s leading producers of fine wines.
As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Mario’s son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.
In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Home’s original philosophy to offer ”a great product for a fair price,” even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.
Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.

15, Josh Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,N/A,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$19.69,$14.99,"
Tom Larson once owned this single vineyard in the mountains of the Red Hills. This Vineyard is where for the past 10 years, all grapes have been organically grown and sustainably farmed.
This appellation sits at the highest section between the Vaca and Mayacamas mountain ranges. The Mayacamas are famous for great Cabernet wine, due in part to ancient pyroclastic soils that contain volcanic glass. Josh Cellars North Coast Vineyards contain obsidian gravel that allows the soils to drain well, which is extremely important for growing Cabernet grapes.
The high elevation sunlight combined with the rich volcanic red soils and obsidian fragments produce quality grapes that are extremely unique to the Red Hills. The vineyard itself sits on an East facing slope with varying altitude from 1200 to 2000 feet. The average daytime summer temperature is 84 degrees with an average nighttime temperature of 51 degrees.

A slow, temperature controlled fermentation is undertaken and after a short period of yeast lees contact, the wine is racked for final blending, then bottled young to ensure that the fresh, crisp and elegant varietal characters are retained.

the series: appellation series
At La Crema, we are rather passionate about terroir. Especially when it comes to Pinot Noir. The In general, terroir conveys the unique characteristics of a site – everything from soil, wind and temperature to the neighboring eucalyptus trees or distance from the sea. For Pinot Noir in particular, it means the subtle expressiveness and texture of one site literally cannot be duplicated elsewhere. Produced in limited quantities, our Appellation Pinot Noirs are rooted in this concept: four exceptional cool-climate growing areas offering clearly
different expressions of this alluring varietal.
the place: russian river valley
Pinot Noir’s temperamental and fragile nature makes it a challenge from vine to bottle. Russian River Valley offers the ideal climate for Pinot to reveal its brilliance. Cool coastal fog rolls over the vineyards each evening and the fruit ripens at a leisurely pace in the moderate climate. Concentrated, small berries literally burst with flavor, wrapped up in heady spice and plush, round texture.

The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

This coastal region’s boundary begins at the Mendocino County border, continues along the western coastal edge of Sonoma County through the mouth of the Russian River Valley; and extends to the Los Carneros region on the southern Sonoma/Napa border. Our Sonoma Coast wines are a tribute to the tremendously fresh, concentrated and layered palette of flavors offered
by these coastal vineyards. Crafted one barrel at a time at our family-owned winery, Sonoma Coast wines offer exceptional balance and fruit intensity.
THE PLACE: SONOMA COAST
Like the Burgundy wine region of France, the vineyards of the Sonoma Coast offer an unusually long, cool and steady growing season. Lingering fog and wind from the nearby Pacific Ocean moderate temperatures throughout the season and slow the ripening process. With an extended “hang” time on the vines, the results at harvest are small berries with firm acidity and highly concentrated varietal aromas and flavors.

Robert Mondavi established his namesake winery in 1966 with a vision to create Napa Valley wines that would stand in the company of the world’s finest. He chose To Kalon Vineyard in the heart of the Napa Valley as the home for Robert Mondavi Winery. This first-growth vineyard, located in Oakville, California, is renowned for producing some of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon wines in the world, as well as for its Sauvignon Blanc grapes, from which Mr. Mondavi crafted his signature wine, Fume Blanc.

Along with To Kalon Vineyard, Robert Mondavi Winery sources grapes from some of Napa Valley’s finest vineyards, including Stag’s Leap (Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon Blanc) and Carneros (Pinot Noir and Chardonnay).

Mr. Mondavi believed that wines should reflect their origins, that they are the product of the soil, the climate, and the careful stewardship of those precious resources. He also believed in combining the newest techniques and technology with time-honored winemaking traditions.

Our winemaking and vineyard teams are proud to carry on our founder’s mandate to always strive higher, to pursue Robert Mondavi’s goal of excellence with the same passion and innovative spirit, moving forward with programs that break barriers and open new frontiers.

Lindeman’s wines contain the spirit and passion of its founder, Dr. Henry J. Lindeman, whose philosophy was to craft wines for everyday enjoyment.
In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.
The winemaking team of nine is spread across Victoria and South Australia. Wayne Falkenberg and his team at the Lindeman’s Karadoc Winery produce wines for the Cawarra, Bin Series and Premier Selection labels, whilst the team based in the Coonawarra produce the Reserve and Coonawarra Trio wines.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.

In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.

93, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

131, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry.

The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.

Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

223, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Lindeman’s wines contain the spirit and passion of its founder, Dr. Henry J. Lindeman, whose philosophy was to craft wines for everyday enjoyment.
In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.

226, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

227, Ecco Domani Pinot Grigio,Italy,Veneto,delle Venezie,Pinot Gris,Still wine,$9.99,$9.99,"
While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.

The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

Lindeman’s wines contain the spirit and passion of its founder, Dr. Henry J. Lindeman, whose philosophy was to craft wines for everyday enjoyment.
In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.
The winemaking team of nine is spread across Victoria and South Australia. Wayne Falkenberg and his team at the Lindeman’s Karadoc Winery produce wines for the Cawarra, Bin Series and Premier Selection labels, whilst the team based in the Coonawarra produce the Reserve and Coonawarra Trio wines.

302, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

394, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.

Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

432, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Lindeman’s wines contain the spirit and passion of its founder, Dr. Henry J. Lindeman, whose philosophy was to craft wines for everyday enjoyment.
In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.

435, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

470, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Lindeman’s wines contain the spirit and passion of its founder, Dr. Henry J. Lindeman, whose philosophy was to craft wines for everyday enjoyment.
In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.
The winemaking team of nine is spread across Victoria and South Australia. Wayne Falkenberg and his team at the Lindeman’s Karadoc Winery produce wines for the Cawarra, Bin Series and Premier Selection labels, whilst the team based in the Coonawarra produce the Reserve and Coonawarra Trio wines.

473, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.
The winemaking team of nine is spread across Victoria and South Australia. Wayne Falkenberg and his team at the Lindeman’s Karadoc Winery produce wines for the Cawarra, Bin Series and Premier Selection labels, whilst the team based in the Coonawarra produce the Reserve and Coonawarra Trio wines.

511, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines.

We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world.

Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power.

Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir.

Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.

The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.

Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.

644, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Lindeman’s wines contain the spirit and passion of its founder, Dr. Henry J. Lindeman, whose philosophy was to craft wines for everyday enjoyment.
In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.
The winemaking team of nine is spread across Victoria and South Australia. Wayne Falkenberg and his team at the Lindeman’s Karadoc Winery produce wines for the Cawarra, Bin Series and Premier Selection labels, whilst the team based in the Coonawarra produce the Reserve and Coonawarra Trio wines.

682, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

774, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.

Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

812, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.

Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.

815, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

850, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Lindeman’s wines contain the spirit and passion of its founder, Dr. Henry J. Lindeman, whose philosophy was to craft wines for everyday enjoyment.
In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.
The winemaking team of nine is spread across Victoria and South Australia. Wayne Falkenberg and his team at the Lindeman’s Karadoc Winery produce wines for the Cawarra, Bin Series and Premier Selection labels, whilst the team based in the Coonawarra produce the Reserve and Coonawarra Trio wines.

853, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.
The winemaking team of nine is spread across Victoria and South Australia. Wayne Falkenberg and his team at the Lindeman’s Karadoc Winery produce wines for the Cawarra, Bin Series and Premier Selection labels, whilst the team based in the Coonawarra produce the Reserve and Coonawarra Trio wines.

891, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County.

While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world.

Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power.

This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir.

Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

983, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.

The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.

Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

1021, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Lindeman’s wines contain the spirit and passion of its founder, Dr. Henry J. Lindeman, whose philosophy was to craft wines for everyday enjoyment.
In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.
The winemaking team of nine is spread across Victoria and South Australia. Wayne Falkenberg and his team at the Lindeman’s Karadoc Winery produce wines for the Cawarra, Bin Series and Premier Selection labels, whilst the team based in the Coonawarra produce the Reserve and Coonawarra Trio wines.

1024, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

1059, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Lindeman’s wines contain the spirit and passion of its founder, Dr. Henry J. Lindeman, whose philosophy was to craft wines for everyday enjoyment.
In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.
The winemaking team of nine is spread across Victoria and South Australia. Wayne Falkenberg and his team at the Lindeman’s Karadoc Winery produce wines for the Cawarra, Bin Series and Premier Selection labels, whilst the team based in the Coonawarra produce the Reserve and Coonawarra Trio wines.

1062, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

The winemaking team of nine is spread across Victoria and South Australia. Wayne Falkenberg and his team at the Lindeman’s Karadoc Winery produce wines for the Cawarra, Bin Series and Premier Selection labels, whilst the team based in the Coonawarra produce the Reserve and Coonawarra Trio wines.

1100, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry.

Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.

The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

1192, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.

1195, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

1230, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Lindeman’s wines contain the spirit and passion of its founder, Dr. Henry J. Lindeman, whose philosophy was to craft wines for everyday enjoyment.
In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.
The winemaking team of nine is spread across Victoria and South Australia. Wayne Falkenberg and his team at the Lindeman’s Karadoc Winery produce wines for the Cawarra, Bin Series and Premier Selection labels, whilst the team based in the Coonawarra produce the Reserve and Coonawarra Trio wines.

1233, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

1268, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Lindeman’s wines contain the spirit and passion of its founder, Dr. Henry J. Lindeman, whose philosophy was to craft wines for everyday enjoyment.
In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.

1271, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

The winemaking team of nine is spread across Victoria and South Australia. Wayne Falkenberg and his team at the Lindeman’s Karadoc Winery produce wines for the Cawarra, Bin Series and Premier Selection labels, whilst the team based in the Coonawarra produce the Reserve and Coonawarra Trio wines.

1309, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry.

Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.

The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

1401, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.
The winemaking team of nine is spread across Victoria and South Australia. Wayne Falkenberg and his team at the Lindeman’s Karadoc Winery produce wines for the Cawarra, Bin Series and Premier Selection labels, whilst the team based in the Coonawarra produce the Reserve and Coonawarra Trio wines.

1404, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

1439, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Lindeman’s wines contain the spirit and passion of its founder, Dr. Henry J. Lindeman, whose philosophy was to craft wines for everyday enjoyment.
In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.
The winemaking team of nine is spread across Victoria and South Australia. Wayne Falkenberg and his team at the Lindeman’s Karadoc Winery produce wines for the Cawarra, Bin Series and Premier Selection labels, whilst the team based in the Coonawarra produce the Reserve and Coonawarra Trio wines.

1442, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

1477, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Lindeman’s wines contain the spirit and passion of its founder, Dr. Henry J. Lindeman, whose philosophy was to craft wines for everyday enjoyment.
In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.
The winemaking team of nine is spread across Victoria and South Australia. Wayne Falkenberg and his team at the Lindeman’s Karadoc Winery produce wines for the Cawarra, Bin Series and Premier Selection labels, whilst the team based in the Coonawarra produce the Reserve and Coonawarra Trio wines.

1480, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

The winemaking team of nine is spread across Victoria and South Australia. Wayne Falkenberg and his team at the Lindeman’s Karadoc Winery produce wines for the Cawarra, Bin Series and Premier Selection labels, whilst the team based in the Coonawarra produce the Reserve and Coonawarra Trio wines.

1518, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.

The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

1610, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.

The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

1648, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Lindeman’s wines contain the spirit and passion of its founder, Dr. Henry J. Lindeman, whose philosophy was to craft wines for everyday enjoyment.
In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.
The winemaking team of nine is spread across Victoria and South Australia. Wayne Falkenberg and his team at the Lindeman’s Karadoc Winery produce wines for the Cawarra, Bin Series and Premier Selection labels, whilst the team based in the Coonawarra produce the Reserve and Coonawarra Trio wines.

1651, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

1686, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Lindeman’s wines contain the spirit and passion of its founder, Dr. Henry J. Lindeman, whose philosophy was to craft wines for everyday enjoyment.
In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.
By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.
Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.
The winemaking team of nine is spread across Victoria and South Australia. Wayne Falkenberg and his team at the Lindeman’s Karadoc Winery produce wines for the Cawarra, Bin Series and Premier Selection labels, whilst the team based in the Coonawarra produce the Reserve and Coonawarra Trio wines.

1689, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

The winemaking team of nine is spread across Victoria and South Australia. Wayne Falkenberg and his team at the Lindeman’s Karadoc Winery produce wines for the Cawarra, Bin Series and Premier Selection labels, whilst the team based in the Coonawarra produce the Reserve and Coonawarra Trio wines.

1727, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

While much of Italy celebrates its past, northern Italy and Milan look to the future. This is where the style-setters create their art, whether it is high fashion, industrial and commercial design, cutting-edge furniture or a lighter, fresher, innovative style of cuisine. Ecco Domani, which means ”here’s tomorrow,” is part of this movement.
Distinctly Italian varietals, Ecco Domani wines are contemporary in style and taste. They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.
Young Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.
Since Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.
