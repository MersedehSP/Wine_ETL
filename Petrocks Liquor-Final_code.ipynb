       "  'description': '\\n”I’ve always been influenced by the idea of Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, which was the inspiration for ultimately all modern amusements parks. I remember the beautiful theater pavilions with the curtains painted with peacock feathers that had little ballet performances. At Tivoli, there were rides, but more important than the rides were the cafes and the refreshments, and just the sense of being in a children’s garden, a ‘pleasure garden’ for all people to enjoy - which perhaps is the best phrase to describe what we’re creating here. This vision was replicated at places on Coney Island, like Luna Park, and George C. Tilyou’s Steeplechase Park, or Palisades Park. These were basically wonderlands, and I thought Francis Ford Coppola Winery could become such a park for the family to go and enjoy, where there are things for kids to do, so they can be close to their parents who are sampling wines and foods.\\nI’ve often felt that modern life tends to separate all the ages too much. In the old days, the children lived with the parents and the grandparents, and the family unit each gave one another something very valuable. So when we began to develop the idea for this winery, we thought it should be like a resort, basically a wine wonderland, a park of pleasure where people of all ages can enjoy the best things in life - food, wine, music, dancing, games, swimming and performances of all types. A place to celebrate the love of life.”\\n\\n- Francis Ford Coppola\\n\\nFor more than thirty years, we have been committed to environmentally responsible business practices. It’s been our goal to minimize our impact on the environment by seeking out innovative ways to produce and package our goods.\\nAt Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all 24 planted acres are sustainably farmed and part of the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program. We try to purchase fruit from growers who farm sustainably, and some of the vineyards we source from are certified organic as well. Another benefit of participating in the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program is that we have subsequently become a learning-teaching vineyard. Every technique we implement is thoroughly documented so that we, and neighboring Sonoma winegrowers, can pinpoint the best ways to protect our land and craft the best wines from these vineyards.\\nWe are also actively involved in the Fish Friendly Farming certification program. While this may seem like a matter totally unrelated to wine, watershed quality management is intrinsically connected to farming our vineyard because our property includes two blue-line creeks. These creeks are a part of the Russian River watershed that supports steelhead trout and Coho salmon populations. In conjunction with our neighbors and local, state, and federal agencies, we work diligently to promote the overall health of the Russian River watershed so that the entire ecosystem remains in balance and is preserved for generations to come.\\nOur winegrowing practices involve the Integrated Pest Management program, which discusses the best practices for maintaining soil and vine health and proactively farming to reduce and treat pest pressures. Field experts provide monthly lectures concerning pest problems and solutions which we implement in our vineyard. Through our integrated pest management program, we have complemented the biodiversity of our vineyard by promoting the presence of beneficial insects, soil fauna, and owls that combat pests of grapevines.\\nFinally, we recycle our grape and water waste by fertilizing with composted grape pomace and irrigating only with reclaimed winery wastewater.  In effect, we have closed the loop on our waste system in an effort to reduce our carbon footprint on the land we so love.\\nOutside of the vineyard, our Francis Coppola Diamond Collection wines are packaged in 100% recycled cardboard case boxes, and all of the corks we purchase come from sustainable cork forests. Additionally, we insist that the label and foil companies we do business with have environmentally friendly practices as well.\\nDuring the reconstruction of Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all of the crews, vendors, and sub-contractors we hired were local residents, helping to cut down on transportation costs, as well as supporting the economy of our community.\\nRather than use new lumber for the construction, we reused the wood from the Redwood trees that were removed from the courtyard area. Some of this timber was used to build the main reception desk in the Guest Services building, while other portions has been used to build the outdoor dining tables. The pyramid skylights in our towers feature an environmentally friendly material called Kalwall to construct skylights. This material diffuses light in such a way that little artificial lighting is needed, which helps conserve energy.\\n',\n",

       "  'description': '\\nAt Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the world’s leading producers of fine wines.\\nAs the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Mario’s son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.\\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Home’s original philosophy to offer ”a great product for a fair price,” even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.\\nToday, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.\\n',\n",

For Pinot Noir in particular, it means the subtle expressiveness and texture of one site literally cannot be duplicated elsewhere. Produced in limited quantities, our Appellation Pinot Noirs are rooted in this concept: four exceptional cool-climate growing areas offering clearly\\ndifferent expressions of this alluring varietal.\\nthe place: russian river valley\\nPinot Noir’s temperamental and fragile nature makes it a challenge from vine to bottle.

With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir.

Within SA, the McLaren Vale and the Barossa are the most diverse and historic sub-regions with vines dating back to the 1830’s. The microclimates within these areas are what give Layer Cake Shiraz its complexity. For our Shiraz, we pull from vineyards in McLaren Vale and the Barossa Valley; from the sandy soiled blocks on the sea coast of Gulf St. Vincent, to the Terra Rosa based, tiny-berried wind-blown rolling hills in the Barossa Zone. The microclimates give us a broad array of flavors to blend into a complex, rich, full wine.\\n',\n",

While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley.

Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.\\n',\n",

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night.

With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price.

They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.\\nYoung Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.\\nSince Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.\\n',\n",

It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry.

Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price.

It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry.

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.\\nAt Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.\\n',\n",

Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.\\n',\n",

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.\\nSince Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States.

It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry.

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.\\nSince Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States.

It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.\\n',\n",

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.\\nSince Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States.

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry.

With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir.

Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price.

It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry.

Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price.

While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.\\nThe inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.\\n',\n",

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.\\nYoung Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.\\nSince Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.\\n',\n",

Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.\\n',\n",

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.\\nSince Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States.

They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.\\nYoung Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.\\nSince Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States.

With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price.

Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry.

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.\\n',\n",

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.\\nThe inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.\\n',\n",

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.\\nYoung Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.\\nSince Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.\\n',\n",

In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.\\nThe inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.\\n',\n",

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.\\nSince Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.\\n',\n",

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.\\nYoung Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.\\nSince Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.\\n',\n",

It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry.

Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price.

Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.\\n',\n",

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.\\nAt Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.\\n',\n",

Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.\\n',\n",

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.\\nSince Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States.

It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry.

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.\\nSince Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States.

It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.\\n',\n",

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.\\nSince Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States.

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry.

With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir.

Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price.

It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry.

Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price.

While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.\\nThe inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.\\n',\n",

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.\\nYoung Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.\\nSince Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.\\n',\n",

Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.\\n',\n",

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.\\nSince Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States.

They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.\\nYoung Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.\\nSince Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States.

With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price.

Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry.

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.\\n',\n",

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.\\nThe inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.\\n',\n",

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.\\nYoung Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.\\nSince Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.\\n',\n",

In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.\\nThe inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.\\nThe wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.\\n',\n",

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.\\nSince Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.\\n',\n",

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.\\nThis unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.\\n14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.\\n',\n",

They are easy-to-drink, well-balanced wines concentrating on the best qualities of the fruit and the regions in which they are grown, rather than on excessive winemaker influence or oak aging.\\nYoung Italian winemaker Fabrizio Gatto and his colleagues scour Italy’s premier growing regions for wines that express the best characteristics of the areas, creating wines that exhibit the best that Italy has to offer. The wines are fashioned into final blends and bottled in a stunning state-of-the-art facility in Trento, Italy. ”By choosing the very best grapes from the finest regions of Italy, it is possible for us to craft exquisite wines with marvelous complexity. The intricate fruit flavors which result in the finished wines are unsurpassed, and marry well with a variety of superb cuisines,” says Fabrizio Gatto.\\nSince Ecco Domani’s debut in 1996, it has become the leading premium Imported brand in the United States. Impact Magazine named Ecco Domani as a ”Hot Brand” for six consecutive years. The wines are currently sold in the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.\\n',\n",

Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.\\nAt Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.\\n',\n",
