This is the heart of bourbon country. Nearly 2,000 miles away, vineyards stretch across the rolling hills of some of California’s most premier wine regions. Wheatridge Cellars seeks to bring these places together in one bottle through aging in bourbon barrels.

VINEYARD INFO/REGION
For this wine, we source grapes from California’s best growing regions. The climate is generally Mediterranean, though regions closer to the Pacific Ocean benefit from cool breezes. The 2017 vintage brought a close to the multiyear drought—filling reservoirs and bringing new life to cover crops, and then to the vines. Lots are selected to blend the characteristics from these varied regions.

WINEMAKING/VITICULTURE
From all across California, our winemaking team hand selects several grape varieties to use in our premium Red Blend. A portion of this wine then goes into used bourbon barrels, which impart the warm, caramel and coffee flavors of fine bourbon. Final blending helps to integrate both flavor profiles, creating a complex, multilayered wine.

TASTING NOTES
For this wine, traditional aromas of both premium red wine and bourbon mingle in the glass - black cherry, raspberry, molasses, and charred vanilla invite you in for a sip. On the palate, rich notes of black cherry and blackberry layer over brown sugar, coffee, and caramel.

TASTING NOTES: Plush plum and black cherry on the nose are flanked by more dark fruits and dried herbs on the palate—think oregano and thyme.

Vintage
The vines were rejuvenated from winter rains allowing the 2017 growing season to thrive during spring and summer. A severe heat wave prior to harvest reduced the overall crop yield, giving the remaining Cabernet grapes extended hang time to develop deep color, good extraction and full flavor.

Winemaking
The grapes for our Prospect & Main Cabernet Sauvignon reflect all that defines the diverse and distinct growing regions in California. Blending the finest fruit from warm and cool vineyard sites create a wine embodying the state’s rich terroir of ripe flavors, balanced acidity and fine tannins.

Rancho Costero Cabernet Sauvignon Paso Robles,United States,Paso Robles,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,14.99,"Spanish for “coastal ranch,” Rancho Costero wines are an embodiment of Paso Robles. This historic growing region boasts an ideal micro-climate for producing premium quality grapes with unmistakable terroir.

VINEYARD INFO/REGION
Paso Robles has been a wine-growing region since 1797. As it grew into a more premium region in the 1950s and 60s, Cabernet Sauvignon became one of the top varietals. With a long growing season consisting of plenty of sunshine and Pacific breezes, Paso Robles is an ideal location for producing high quality Cab.

WINEMAKING/VITICULTURE
Across the Paso region, vintners rejoiced over the success of the growing season. A wet winter fed the reservoirs and enabled healthy cover crops to regenerate the soils. Even temperatures allowed for the desired ripening of Cabernet grapes with a slightly earlier than average harvest.

TASTING NOTES
This wine is full-bodied with generous flavors of cassis, crushed red berries, and dried herbs. The finish is soft and juicy, showing a hint of toasty oak and vanilla.

Rougeot Bourgogne Blanc Grandes Gouttes,France,Burgundy,NA,Chardonnay,27.99,"Organic.  100% Chardonnay.  The lieu-dit “Les Grandes Gouttes” sits at the southern edge of Meursault on border with Pugligny, just a few hundred meters below the Premier Cru vineyard Les Charmes.  The vineyard is only a hectare size and the vines were planted between 1950 – 1980 on clay-limestone soils.  Hand-harvested, direct pressing in whole bunches untrimmed, and cold settling for 2 days.  Alcoholic fermentation with natural yeasts begins in a concrete vat and then pumped into French oak barrels to undergo malolactic fermentation (5% new oak).  Aging in oak barrels for 12 months.   

""In the center of Meursault village, Pierre-Henri Rougeot has been quietly producing impeccable minimal intervention, low-sulfur wines since he returned to the family domaine in 2010. The 18th century stone cellar was originally built for the Hospices de Beaune to press the fruit from the adjacent orchards, and was purchased Pierre-Henri’s great-great-grandfather in the 19th century. Today the orchards have been transformed into an elegant garden and stamp-sized monopole vineyard, and the cellar has been renovated to comfortably hold two vintages from Rougeot’s 13 hectares of vines in and around Meursault.

Pierre-Henri’s experience travelling throughout France gives him a unique vision that hews strongly to Burgundian tradition with a soft touch inspired by the vins natures made by his friends in Saumur, Cahors, and beyond. Today, the Rougeot vineyards are farmed organically, and Pierre-Henri’s no sulfur vinification effortlessly balances a natural wine approach with traditional Burgundian technique to create wines with energy and balance. Each terroir from Aligoté and Passetoutgrain through Premier Crus is bottled as a single-vineyard designate. The wines are energetic, precise, and delicious. It’s simply astounding that the domaine has maintained a quiet profile while producing such compelling wines. It will be even more astounding if that continues.""",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

It offers light to medium body and pretty, caramelized grapefruit and floral notes with melons. It is dry, crisp, zesty, and ideal for drinking over the next several years.

The nose is much more elegant than the Pintia from Toro (I tasted them together), still very fresh and primary but with a special brightness of fruit, shiny cherries, raspberries, something effervescent, open and somehow exuberant. The palate is quite round, much more polished, with some notes of dark chocolate, some subtle volatility, elegant, fresh and long. It has the balance and stuffing to develop nicely in bottle. Superb balance, Ribera character, clean, modern classic. 280,000 bottles were produced.

Altesino is now celebrating the release of its 40th harvest. In fact, the 2012 Brunello di Montalcino is inscribed with the words ""our 40th Harvest"" in gold letters on its front label. This is a truly delicious wine that exceeds my expectations. I love the way it takes full command of the slightly bolder and more opulent dark fruit aromas produced in this hot vintage. Black cherry, plum and crème de cassis converge on the bouquet. Grilled herb, forest floor, licorice and exotic spice play supporting roles. The finish offers moderate acidity on the Sangiovese scale. This means the wine is mush fresher and more tonic than most Tuscan reds. The finish is long and silky.- Monica Larner

Alto Moncayo Garnacha,Spain,Campo De Borja,NA,Garnacha,39.99,"<font size=""16px"" color=""#800000""><b>WA 90</b></font>
Cropped from a vintage of average temperatures, but more rain than normal, the 2014 Alto Moncayo followed the usual fermentation in small tanks with neutral yeasts and 18 months in new French and 35% American oak barrels. 2014 was a balanced year with normal yields. Both wines are from old, head-pruned Garnacha vines. They do a selection for Aquilón, sometimes part of the plots and sometimes a barrel selection. This is powerful and concentrated, ripe and generously oaked, finding its balance in an XL style. I found the last couple of vintages better balanced and with better-integrated oak than in the past. This is definitely riper than the 2013, slightly different in style but at a similar level of quality. 54,600 bottles were filled in July 2016.- Luis Gutierrez

An impressively long, mineral-laced finish features silky, even tannins and an echo of lavender pastille.- Josh Raynolds

A more restrained, elegant, structured vintage for this wine (I suspect more due to winemaking than the vintage), the 2014 Alto Moncayo is 100% Grenache brought up in French and American oak. It sports a vibrant ruby/purple color as well as a ripe, yet elegant style in its black raspberries, blueberry, white pepper, and floral aromas and flavors. Full-bodied and concentrated on the palate, with good acidity and a pure, focused character, it needs an hour in the decanter if drinking anytime soon, and should have 10-12 years of overall longevity. It's reminiscent of a modern styled Châteauneuf du Pape (the cuvée Juline from Paul Autard?) and is a gorgeous wine.- Jeb Dunnuck",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

Anselmi San Vincenzo IGT Veneto,Italy,Veneto,Veneto,"Garganega, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc",14.99,"This is a lovely Italian white wine. Roberto Anselmi left college in 1975 to work in his father’s winery. During and after the horrors of World War II, Roberto's grandfather had been forced to sell the family vineyards, so Roberto's father relied on purchased grapes. Roberto gradually acquired hillside vineyards, which he replanted at high density using the low-yielding Guyot trellis system as opposed to the commonly used but much higher-yielding double pergola system. His clones of Garganega (the white variety of Soave) are less productive and higher quality than is commonly used. Frustrated by the low quality and general lack of ambition in the Soave region, he left the Soave DOC in 2000, and his wines are now labelled IGT Veneto. ‘No one is focused on the real quality,' he says. 'I use 7000 plants/hectare as opposed to 1200. I have 3 bunches per plant as opposed to 15. These are two different philosophies of life.’ The varietals he uses are also distinctive, a blend of 80% Garganega and 10% each Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. Roberto's wines are impressive in a modern, forward style, and they are excellent values. The San Vicenzo shows lovely fruit unobscured by oak. It is very pure and fresh with hints of citrus, apple, and lemon blossom. The palate shows lovely freshness, richness, and style. Wine Spectator: 88 “Fresh and floral, with apricot, grapefruit granita, candied ginger, and stone notes.

B Moreau Chassagne Montrachet Rouge,France,Chassagne Montrachet,Burgundy,Pinot Noir,59.99,"It’s impossible to discuss Chassagne-Montrachet without mentioning the name Bernard Moreau. Year to year, this celebrated producer vinifies and bottles some of the purest, most thought-provoking wines of the appellation. Employing a style of wine making that might best be described as hands-off, Bernard produces Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays that are sensual, opulent and utterly delicious.

The winery’s roots go back to 1809 when Auguste Moreau built a cellar across from the Champs Gain vineyard and farmed his few hectares of Chardonnay and Pinot along the golden slope. The 1930s saw an expansion of the family’s vineyards under the guidance of Marcel Moreau. Roughly 80% of the domaine’s current vineyard holdings were acquired by Marcel. At age 14, Bernard Moreau took over the vineyards and cellar in the early 1960’s. In 1977 the reputation of this great estate was fully established under the leadership of Bernard and Françoise Moreau and the winery was named Domaine Bernard Moreau. In addition to the changes in equipment, farming and wine making, they also purchased additional land bringing the vineyard total to 14 hectares. To help with wine making, viticulture and sales, sons Alex and Benoît joined the Domaine after having worked in New Zealand, Australia and South Africa.

Alex and Benoit have loosely split the responsibilities of the operation with Benoit more focused on the vineyards and Alex more focused on the cellar.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

Badenhorst Secateurs Chenin Blanc,South Africa,Swartland,Western Cape,Chenin Blanc,13.99,"""The Chenin Blanc grapes used are from our farm, Kalmoesfontein, as well as our direct neighbours and are all mountain sloped bushvines. We maintain that high quality fruit comes from old un-irrigated bushvines grown on a variety of granite soils that are naturally low yielding. Most of our Chenin vines were planted the 1960s and tend to yield around 4 tons/hectare. 

The grapes are hand picked with great care and chilled overnight in a cold room. The following day they are whole bunch pressed to a settling tank. These vineyards were picked over a period of 12 days and each day fresh juice was added to the already fermenting tanks  this extended the alcoholic fermentation by about 20 days but was also very important in the complete integration of the wine as all the various vineyards or components were fermented together. Some of the wine was also fermented in old casks  this makes up around 8% of the final blend. Maturation: This wine was left on its gross lees for 7 months before being bottled with occasional lees stirring during this time.  The aromas are flinty with honey, orange blossom and white stone fruit notes.All our wines are minimally fined and filtered so occasionally they will throw a harmless deposit.""",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

Bonterra Chardonnay,United States,NA,California,Chardonnay,11.99,"Our organic fruit offers the characteristic flavors of green apples, pears, and citrus to our chardonnay.

The remaining 30% is fermented in stainless steel to preserve the crisp fresh fruit flavors. We age most of the wine using previously-used or neutral oak in order for these fresh fruit characteristics to shine through. New oak was used for just 15% of the wine to give this chardonnay a nice vanilla note.

An initial impression of rich, buttery cream quickly turns to aromas of honey and lightly toasted almonds, followed by tropical aromas of pineapple, citrusy lemon and crème brulee. The wine is refreshing on the palate, with a minerality that is both bright and clean, drawing you into a vibrant tartness and lemon zest that is absolutely, positively Bonterra Chardonnay, vintage after vintage.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

Indeed, the  estate  is  one  of the few in Montalcino that  has vineyards in the  various geographic  areas  of the  Appellation.  What  might  seem  to  be  just  a  detail  is  instead  quite  positive,  because  the different  locations  of  Caparzo's  vineyards  allow  the  estate  to  draw  the  most  from  the  different microclimates  and  terroirs  present  in  Montalcino.  The  grapes  harvested  from  the  vineyards  in the  various  areas  of  the  appellation  are  carefully  selected  to  lay  the  foundations  for  a  complex wine  that    brings  together  all  of  the  characteristics  that  make  Brunello  one  of  the  the  world's most sought after wines.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

Viticulture and vinification are consistent across all Desvignes wines. The vines are organically farmed and harvested by hand. The fruit is generally fermented in whole clusters (with some variation by vintage: in 2017 La Voûte was completely destemmed due to severe hail damage) in open-top concrete vats, with a maceration of 12-13 days and with a submerged cap. La Voûte is bottled in April following the harvest. Annual production is approximately 2000 cases, making it the largest Desvignes bottling.

Soil: The soils in the vineyard are mainly composed of Kimmeridgian and Portlandian (Upper Jurassic) calcareous clay. The subsoil is limestone.

Viticulture: The soil is worked around each vine to improve microbiological soil life.  Most of the parcels have grass growing between the rows of vines to prevent soil erosion and ensure better ripening of the grapes.  No herbicides, insecticides, etc. are employed. Practicing organic but not yet certified.  The vines are pruned according to the single Guyot method and later in the growing cycle the winemakers perform disbudding and green harvest to an extent that varies each year in order to limit production and obtain healthy and homogenous grapes.

Harvest: Manual harvest; sorting of the grapes on the sorting table.  The choice of growing methods used and the harvest date are crucial to ensure that the grapes reach their peak of ripeness.

Vinification: The winemakers use gravity (no pumping). The juice, and later on the wine, is handled as little as possible so that it expresses all of the aromatic characteristics the terroirs have to offer.  Gentle pressing of the grapes. Vinification and aging in clay cement tanks on the fine lees for 8 months (depending on the vintage).

Tasting Notes: Clear, straw color.  The nose is expressive with notes of citrus and a hint of tropical fruits.  On the palate, it is fresh and vibrant, ripe yet balanced, and not at all aggressive.  Medium length on the fruity finish.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

The origin of the name Vieux Lazaret dates back to the 18th century when there existed in the center of the village of Châteauneuf-du-Pape a hospice or Lazaret. This offered comfort and shelter for the poor and infirm, provided by the Lazarists, who were a silent order of monks founded in 1625 by St Vincent de Paul to look after the sick and the needy in the French countryside. They took the name Lazarists from the Priory of St Lazare in Paris, where the original order had been formed in 1632.

The Lazarists in Châteauneuf-du-Pape played a major role in taking in and looking after the sick during the terrible epidemic of the plague, which killed a third of the population in 1720. Subsequently the buildings fell into disuse and were sold by the Commune during the 19th century to the Quiot family and used as agricultural buildings. Being situated in the village of Châteauneuf-du-Pape and close to other properties owned by the Quiot family, these original buildings have today been extended and modernised, and now form the center of winemaking for Vignobles Famille Quiot. With this historical association going back over several centuries, the Quiot family decided in 1915 to give the name of Domaine du Vieux Lazaret to their principal Domaine.

Today, Domaine du Vieux Lazaret is exported to more than 43 countries around the world. It can be found on the best tables and regularly wins medals in wine competitions throughout the world.

Vineyards
The vineyards of Domaine du Vieux Lazaret are spread over 93 hectares (230 acres), split into 35 different parcels of vines throughout A.O.C. Châteauneuf-du-Pape. It is today amongst the largest domaines in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, with 83 hectares (205 acres) planted in red grape varieties and 10 planted with white grapes. The number of parcels enables the Domaine to give greater complexity to its wines due to the diversity of soils, grape types and differing ages of vines.

Viticulture
The viticultural practices are strictly controlled and follow those traditions practised for many generations. The pruning is only done by those vineyard workers who are extremely experienced, and follow the strict rules of the appellation, with some vines trained on wires and others trained low to the ground. The soil in the vineyard is regularly worked to allow proper aeration, with regular application of compost, and other treatments to maintain the best organic level and condition of the soil. Harvesting of the grapes is done entirely by hand, with very strict selection of the best grapes to enhance the quality of the Domaine wine. The vines have an average age of 40 years.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

This example is somewhere in the middle. It has plenty of fruit and much more finesse than the highly extracted, big ones. It’s also half the price.

ERA Montepulciano comes from the Chieti area of Abruzzo. It is medium-ruby in color with red cherry, dried fruit, subtle oak, and savory herb aromas. The wine is medium-bodied with a soft texture, very pleasing berry fruit, light cedar, and more savory herb notes on the palate. It is organic (and vegan and vegetarian). Actually the label says “made with organic grapes.” This designation requires strict organic practices in the vineyard and in the winery, but allows the use of sulfites in the making of the wine, although they are generally minimal. A “certified organic” designation on the label does not allow for the use of sulfites. Many early “made with organic grapes” wines were poorly made with off aromas and flavors, but this one is modern, clean, balanced, and bright. 

Cantina Volpi began their organic ERA projects in 1999 out of concerns for environmental issues. Cantina Volpi has wineries in Veneto, Marche, Abruzzo, Apulia, and Sicily. They work with organically certified vineyards in each of these regions. All vineyard work is done by hand, and fermentation is uses only natural yeast. Certification is made by I.C.E.A. (the Italian Institute for Ethic and Environmental Certification), which is accredited in the U.S. by the USDA.  The goddess Era was the Queen of Olympus in Greek mythology.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

Foxglove expands that range with moderately priced wines like this Paso Robles Cabernet, which is bold and intense yet not at all a fruit bomb. It’s juicy and balanced and will go well with steaks and chops.” Varner Vineyards is the life and love of Jim and Bob Varner. Bob is the winemaker, Jim is the business guy. They grow the grapes for their estate Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays around the winery in Santa Cruz. The grapes for the foxglove wines are purchased. The Cabernet Sauvignon, which is a nearly 11,000-case cuvée, comes from northern Paso Robles from all hillside vineyards and represents a soft, round, juicy, succulent style of Cabernet.

Franzia Pinot Grigio,United States,NA,California,Pinot Grigio,17.99,"Since 1906. The world's most popular wine. Award winning wines. The Story Behind Franzia: A new beginning - Teresa Franzia, my grandmother, planted her first vineyard along the road to Yosemite in 1906. Her family survived Prohibition by selling these grapes to home wine makers back East. When Prohibition ended, my father and his six brothers and sisters rebuilt the winery brick by brick, barrel by barrel - everyone pitched in. After the war, my uncles new advertising slogan, make friends with Franzia, introduced a new generation to wine. Our revolutionary fresh to the last glass Winetap system made its debut in 1978. Because it was more convenient and offered better value than bottles, Franzia started to catch on. It went on to become the world's most popular wine and the first (and only) Winetap to freshness date every package. As we enter our second century of winemaking, we strive to uphold Teresa's legacy of quality, freshness and value. Not just by winning competitions around the world, but more importantly, by helping to bring the enjoyment of good wine to your home each night. The World's most popular wine is also the World's most cost and carbon efficient wine. We are proud of what we are doing and we plan to do more. Significantly Less CO2 Emissions: Franzia WineTaps use significantly smaller energy resources in packaging production and fabrication. Significantly Less Packaging Waste: With 85% less landfill waste than traditional glass, Franzia WineTaps dramatically reduce the environmental burden of excess packaging. Smaller Carbon Footprint: 50% more carbon efficient than 750ml glass bottles. Lighter than heavy glass bottles, Franzia WineTaps require fewer trucks to deliver the same amount of wine resulting in less emissions, less pollution, less cost and less greenhouse gases. Less Wine Waste: This award-winning wine stays fresh to the last glass, even after the package has been opened, because Franzia's patented spout and unique inner pouch prevent the oxidation that occurs in half empty wine-in-bottles. Enjoy for at least 6 weeks after opening. Alc 12% by volume.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

citrus blossom. A generous palate with citrus and cassis flavours, deliciously ripe and succulent, finishing with that classic Marlborough zing. Fruit was sourced from various prime vineyard sites in Marlborough’s Southern Valleys and the central Wairau Plains, specifically in Woodbourne, Renwick and Rapaura. Soil types vary from the young alluvial soils of Rapaura and Renwick, which contain high proportions of New Zealand’s ubiquitous greywacke river stones, to the older and denser clay-loams of the Southern Valleys. The majority of the vineyards were trained using the divided Scott Henry canopy management system, with the balance on a two- or three-cane VSP (vertical shoot positioning) trellis. Sauvignon blanc was harvested largely by machine during the cool (often cold) night-time conditions. Fruit was harvested directly into half-tonne bins, which were tipped directly into a tank press. The grapes were pressed relatively lightly and the resulting juice was cold-settled prior to fermentation. The juice was fermented in stainless steel tanks, primarily
using cultured yeast with a cool, slow fermentation. A portion was allowed to undergo spontaneous indigenous yeast fermentation using slightly warmer fermentation regimes.
All individual vineyard batches were left on lees and kept separate until late July, when the blend was assembled.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

One voice boomed back to the listeners on Earth declaring, ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."" This brand focuses on the emotions at play during the American Space Age, producing a grounded authenticity that speaks of the wine inside.

After being picked cold in the early morning hours, we follow a rigorous program modeled after the techniques used to produce our favorite southern-France rosés. Whole clusters go directly to into the press upon arrival, and the delicate juice is slowly fermented at ultra-low temperatures en route to early bottling, all in our quest to preserve maximum freshness.

With its classic pale pink “eye of the partridge color,” prized by rosé producers in Provence, the 2018 Space Age Rosé delivers an amazingly fresh, vibrant rush of bright aromas of strawberry, rose petal hibiscus and cranberry. The crisp natural acidity keeps these aromas alive and fresh on the palate and through the surprisingly long, fragrant finish.

When the wine has breathed slightly, a discreet dash of vanilla coupled with nuances of fresh butter and freshly baked bread. Flavors are supple, honest and powerful. The wine seems to launch into lively aromas that are lightness itself, perfectly orchestrated scents of cooked fruits admirably sharpened by a dash of eau-de-vie, preserve figs and quince jelly. Sparkling with fine fresh bubbles, the wine grows rounder as it develops, offering heady notes of exotic fruits (mango, lychees and passion fruit).
Pair with a white meat (veal, poultry) in a creamy sauce or a sweet-sour meal (duck with pears or peaches) are ideal partners of this lively champagne.

Lacourte Godbillon Champagne Millesime 1er Cru,France,Champagne,Champagne,"Sparkling, Champagne, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Vintage, Millisime, 90 Point Wine, Systainable, France",79.99,"Our vision for the wine is simple, almost simplistic: It must be an expression of its terroir. The oak used for our barrels is sourced from the Écueil forest or from Champagne-Ardenne. Each plot is pressed and vinified separately and the juice is moved by gravity as far as possible and not pumped, to conserve the musts’ intrinsic qualities. Fermentations are temperature controlled and monitored daily. The wines stay in tank or barrel in contact with their lees deposits, without racking, for the whole autumn period, so they develop their full complexity and unique personality. For the wines made in oak barrels, no stirring or filtering is carried out. The chilling process then takes place... outside in the winter cold! The bottles are aged in our cellars for between 30 months and 7 years. This is followed by an average resting time of 3 to 6 months after the yeast deposits have been removed (disgorgement). The optimum ""dosage"" for each wine in each year is decided by several trial tastings. Our objective is to find the best possible balance as each wine is a living being with its own character.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

Lustau Solera Reserva Fino Jarana Sherry,Spain,Jerez,NA,Palomino Fino,14.99,"The NV Fino Jarana, aged in Jerez, has a beautiful, classical Fino nose of chalk, dry hay, dry straw (esparto) and nuts, while the palate is very dry, intense and pungent, long, with a pleasant bitter finish. It's both intense and fine. Drink 2013-2014.  Emilio Lustau is one of the better internationally known names in the Sherry world, which is quite remarkable, as they have never been a very big operation. In fact they can be considered a small- to medium-sized bodega for Sherry; they were selling around 350,000 bottles per year. Furthermore, when more and more bodegas and important names have disappeared, been bought and sold, brands and soleras acquired by big drink corporations, Brandy or other businesses cannibalizing wine in some of the bigger companies, it's refreshing to see a firm still betting firmly on Sherry and working so hard to improve their ranges and their international presence, trying new products (they have produced a small lot of unfiltered biologically aged wine from the three different towns, Jerez, El Puerto and Sanlucar) and experimenting in many different ways. Their range might be too wide (35 to 40 different wines), but that works for them, as they can diversify in different markets and have the correct wine for the price and quality required. They also pioneered the idea to bottle small lots from almacenistas (small bodegas who produce and age wine that they sell to other bodegas rather than offering bottled to consumers) showing the name of the almacenista and the village where the wine has aged. Emilio Lustau was created in 1896 by Jose Ruiz-Berdejo who was himself an almacenista in Jerez; he worked his vineyards and produced wines that he sold to the big exporting houses. In 1940 his son-in-law Emilio Lustau took over and enlarged the business, which in 1950 became an exporting firm. Through the 70's and 80's they continued combining tradition with new ways and ideas. In 1990 the company was bought by Luis Caballero, a businessman from El Puerto de Santa Maria in love with Sherry, whose stellar product was Ponche Caballero, the number one liqueur in Spain at the time. He enlarged the company, purchasing vineyards and in 2001 he acquired some bodegas from their neighbors, Harveys, in Jerez, like the impressive 14-meter high Los Arcos and Las Cruces. In 2008 they bought some famous brands and soleras that had belonged to Domecq and were true icons of Sherry wine in Spain, 4,000 botas in total, 2,600 of them of Fino La Ina, perhaps the better known Sherry brand locally together with Tio Pepe from Gonzalez-Byass. This will bring them additional volume, mainly in the local market, perhaps to become a half-million bottle per year winery. Walking around the bodegas with director Federico Sanchez-Pece, I bumped into some newish-looking barrels and showed surprise. Oh! These are botas that belong to Jameson, we fill them with Oloroso and they stay here two or three years before they take them to Ireland to use them for the aging of their whisky. Breaking new barrels with wine to take away the harsh tannins and the excessive aromatic components of the wood is called envinar in Spanish. Apparently this is a common side-business in some Sherry bodegas, wining' (envinar) new botas for whisky producers, or even selling small quantities of their own, used botas for finishing small lots of special whisky. I have to say that I was extremely impressed with their VORS range, which showed very old, powerful, quality wines and had the feeling that the quality of the Lustau wines seems to be on the way up.<br/>Imported by Europvin, www.europvin.com",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

Merry Edwards Pinot Noir Russian River Valley,United States,Russian River Valley,California,Pinot Noir,29.99,"In one way or another, all of our wines are blends. For single-vineyard wines, special blocks, clones or barrels may be selected and thoughtfully combined. Likewise, our Russian River Pinot is, in a way, the grandest of our blends, as its goal is to portray the heart of our valley. This Pinot Noir’s kaleidoscopic personality was created by melding five unique vineyards, eight singular clones and 12 individual lots.
The bouquet of this wine uncovers memories of ripening blackberry fields, berry compote and warm plum clafoutis. The complexity of frothed and aromatic Mexican chocolate, with its cinnamon, nutmeg, rich cocoa butter and nutty flavor is found here also. Wood-grilled meat, mushrooms and other earthy notes accompany the sweet, toasty and supportive oak.
Smooth and round on the entry, the palate is powerful yet supple, imparting an impression of thickness. Tannins build tension across the body in line with a balanced acid profile. Generous fruit carries over from the aroma joined by dried fig, sarsaparilla and a lingering toastiness. Polished and firm on the finish, this wine has many years to unfold.

Michael David Winery Earthquake Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Lodi,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,22.99,"The Phillips family has been farming since our Great Great Grandfather Andrew Harshner and his wife Lucille homesteaded 160 acres near the town of Lodi, following the Civil War in the 1860s. The region’s natural affinity for grape growing quickly became evident, and by the turn of the century (the last one), twenty-five percent of California’s grape acreage was in Lodi. A generation later saw the demise of many pioneering wineries in the state.
Originally devoted to vegetables, the Phillips’ farms evolved to include many different fruits, including fifteen different wine varietals that were shipped throughout the country during Prohibition with instructions on “how not to have the grapes turn into wine”. Thereby, Prohibition was good for Lodi growers, with families everywhere keeping up the tradition of wine with meals by ordering these grapes and “juice” to be bottled at home.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

It is planted in our Louis Mel vineyard located across the arroyo that runs directly in front of our historic tasting room property. This vineyard is part of the original 92-acre parcel Louis Mel purchased when he first moved to the Livermore Valley. Featuring an elevation range of 575-715 feet above sea level, the Louis Mel vineyard features well-drained gravelly soils that are ideal for growing Sauvignon Blanc.  

The wine was fermented in a combination of stainless steel tanks and neutral French oak barrels. The oak barrels allow the wine to breath and mature during fermentation and early aging, but does not impart oak qualities to the wine. Aged sur lie for four months in neutral French oak barrels with minimal battonage. This adds texture and weight to the palate while maintaining the wines freshness.  

All of these varieties were picked in October 2019. The 2019 vintage was moderate to warm in the Livermore Valley, without any heat spikes. This allowed the fruit to get extra hang time on the vine, which brought out the fruit and floral qualities even more. Overall, we saw good yields, healthy fermentations and high quality wines.  Our 2019 Sauvignon Blanc exhibits aromas of lime zest, green apple and basil, complemented by floral notes of spring blossoms and a gravely minerality. As a barrel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc, with lees aging, this wine presents a layered and textured palate with a balancing acidity that maintains its varietal uniqueness as well as establishing itself as an excellent food wine.

The Valtellina region, located at the base of the pre-Alps on Italy’s border with Switzerland, is an extremely challenging terroir. A narrow, 25 mile-long amphitheater of terraced vineyards that line the north bank of the Adda River, form a deep gorge amid mountainous terrain. This is Italy’s largest terraced area of viticulture: an impressive 1,500 miles of dry walls that support the terraces are distributed over the 25-mile strip. Working this land is a monumental, backbreaking toil.

Steep, nearly vertical vineyards from 2,400 to 3,000 feet elevation rule out the use of any mechanical equipment. All work, from removing soil to harvesting grapes is done by hand. The star and primary varietal here is Chiavennasca, the local name for Nebbiolo. The variety has been cultivated here for over 1,000 years and it is said that it was brought from here to neighboring Piedmont in the 14th Century.

Pesquera Crianza Tinto,Spain,Ribera Del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,32.99,"Elaborated for lovers of good wine who bet for a safe value. A world famous wine that reflects the character of an entire land full of stories, customs and charm; where modernity and tradition go hand in hand. A mythical wine to enjoy now and in a few years that will delight any palate. Distinguished by its personality, bouquet and structure. A gift for the senses, unalterable in the face of wine-making, with an exceptional value for the money.

The 1970’s brought the realization of a lifetime dream for a young and determined Alejandro Fernández. Propelled by his conviction that wines of superb quality could once again be made in the place of his birth, he went against the movement of the time, when cereal and beetroot dominated the Riberanhillsides, and planted Tempranillo vineyards in his hometown of Pesquera. In 1982, this iconic winemaking pioneer, who came to be recognized as the “Master of Tempranillo,” was the keystone in forming the now-famous D.O. Ribera del Duero, a designation that Alejandro helped to create with only a few other winemaking pioneers.

Tinto Pesquera’s 200 hectares of vineyards lie near the Duero River at close to 2,400 feet in elevation. The vines grow in poor, well-drained soils, composed of sand and gravel over a limestone and clay subsoil, and are naturally irrigated with water from the nearby Duero River. Tinto Pesquera’s vines are located within the province of Valladolid, in the heart of Ribera del Duero, which has hot summers, incredibly cold winters and extreme diurnal temperature differences that create an ideal combination for producing silky and sumptuous Tempranillo wines. The Tinto Pesquera Crianza is made from estate-grown, 40-year-old vines that produce a limited production of only two kilos per vine.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

The bottled 2014s include the 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa, which is 93% Cabernet Sauvignon and 7% Petit Verdot. A classic much in keeping with the vintage characteristics, this charmer is loaded with sweet black and red currant fruit, some spice box, earth, and subtle oak. It is up-front, irresistible, full-bodied and layered with fruit and glycerin. The finish displays sweet tannin and the wine can be drunk now or cellared between 15-20 years.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"
Pio Cesare Barolo,Italy,Barolo,Piedmont,Nebbiolo,69.99,"<font size=""16px"" color=""#800000""><b>WA 95</b></font>
The Pio Cesare 2013 Barolo offers all of the plentiful qualities that make this such a memorable vintage. Because the growing season was slightly cooler compared to the two years preceding it, 2013 offers a great sense of freshness and brightness. Fruit was sourced from seven different vineyard sites (with much of it coming from Serralunga d'Alba). Starting in 2015, Monforte d'Alba fruit will be added. The tannins are tightly integrated within the firm fabric of the wine. Yet, the finish is round and supple. This Barolo offers characteristic aromas of wild berry, black truffle and cola. It is executed in a very traditional style with botte grande and a tiny part barrique to give the wine a tad more oxygen during its integration and aging process.- Monica Larner

The 2013 Barolo is a very pretty wine from proprietor Pio Boffa. As always, the blend of sites Pio Cesare favors yields a distinctive Barolo with quite a bit of complexity. Medium in body and intensely aromatic, the 2013 can be enjoyed with minimal cellaring. The orange peel, exotic spice, kirsch and mint notes all give the wine plenty of allure, while the tannins are quite soft for a young Barolo. All the elements are very nicely balanced. Pio Cesare's Barolo is a wine that does not seem to get much attention, but it is consistently delicious, fairly priced and relatively easy to find, a combination of virtues that is noteworthy.

The aromas to this are really impressive with crushed berries, dried flowers, walnuts and roses. Metamorphoses all the time.
