 Coppola Diamond Chardonnay,United States,California,N/A,Chardonnay,Still wine,$14.99,$11.99,"”I’ve always been influenced by the idea of Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, which was the inspiration for ultimately all modern amusements parks. I remember the beautiful theater pavilions with the curtains painted with peacock feathers that had little ballet performances. At Tivoli, there were rides, but more important than the rides were the cafes and the refreshments, and just the sense of being in a children’s garden, a ‘pleasure garden’ for all people to enjoy - which perhaps is the best phrase to describe what we’re creating here. This vision was replicated at places on Coney Island, like Luna Park, and George C. Tilyou’s Steeplechase Park, or Palisades Park. These were basically wonderlands, and I thought Francis Ford Coppola Winery could become such a park for the family to go and enjoy, where there are things for kids to do, so they can be close to their parents who are sampling wines and foods.I’ve often felt that modern life tends to separate all the ages too much. In the old days, the children lived with the parents and the grandparents, and the family unit each gave one another something very valuable. So when we began to develop the idea for this winery, we thought it should be like a resort, basically a wine wonderland, a park of pleasure where people of all ages can enjoy the best things in life - food, wine, music, dancing, games, swimming and performances of all types. A place to celebrate the love of life.”- Francis Ford CoppolaFor more than thirty years, we have been committed to environmentally responsible business practices. It’s been our goal to minimize our impact on the environment by seeking out innovative ways to produce and package our goods.At Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all 24 planted acres are sustainably farmed and part of the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program. We try to purchase fruit from growers who farm sustainably, and some of the vineyards we source from are certified organic as well. Another benefit of participating in the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program is that we have subsequently become a learning-teaching vineyard. Every technique we implement is thoroughly documented so that we, and neighboring Sonoma winegrowers, can pinpoint the best ways to protect our land and craft the best wines from these vineyards.We are also actively involved in the Fish Friendly Farming certification program. While this may seem like a matter totally unrelated to wine, watershed quality management is intrinsically connected to farming our vineyard because our property includes two blue-line creeks. These creeks are a part of the Russian River watershed that supports steelhead trout and Coho salmon populations. In conjunction with our neighbors and local, state, and federal agencies, we work diligently to promote the overall health of the Russian River watershed so that the entire ecosystem remains in balance and is preserved for generations to come.Our winegrowing practices involve the Integrated Pest Management program, which discusses the best practices for maintaining soil and vine health and proactively farming to reduce and treat pest pressures. Field experts provide monthly lectures concerning pest problems and solutions which we implement in our vineyard. Through our integrated pest management program, we have complemented the biodiversity of our vineyard by promoting the presence of beneficial insects, soil fauna, and owls that combat pests of grapevines.Finally, we recycle our grape and water waste by fertilizing with composted grape pomace and irrigating only with reclaimed winery wastewater.  In effect, we have closed the loop on our waste system in an effort to reduce our carbon footprint on the land we so love.Outside of the vineyard, our Francis Coppola Diamond Collection wines are packaged in 100% recycled cardboard case boxes, and all of the corks we purchase come from sustainable cork forests. Additionally, we insist that the label and foil companies we do business with have environmentally friendly practices as well.During the reconstruction of Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all of the crews, vendors, and sub-contractors we hired were local residents, helping to cut down on transportation costs, as well as supporting the economy of our community.Rather than use new lumber for the construction, we reused the wood from the Redwood trees that were removed from the courtyard area. Some of this timber was used to build the main reception desk in the Guest Services building, while other portions has been used to build the outdoor dining tables. The pyramid skylights in our towers feature an environmentally friendly material called Kalwall to construct skylights. This material diffuses light in such a way that little artificial lighting is needed, which helps conserve energy.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Sycamore Lane Pinot Grigio,United States,California,N/A,Pinot Gris,Still wine,$5.99,$4.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the world’s leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Mario’s son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Home’s original philosophy to offer ”a great product for a fair price,” even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Joel Gott Merlot,United States,California,N/A,Merlot,Still wine,$19.69,$15.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the world’s leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Mario’s son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Home’s original philosophy to offer ”a great product for a fair price,” even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites.

 Cakebread Chardonnay,United States,California,Napa County,Chardonnay,Still wine,$59.99,$39.99,"Our Chardonnay fruit was 100% whole-cluster-pressed to minimize astringency from the skins. Pressing the fruit cold assures even lower extraction of astringent compounds, which also increases the long term aging potential in white wines. Three quarters of the juice was barrel fermented in 35% new French oak barrels at 50-55º F, a slow, cool fermentation that fostered a perfect balance of ripe fruit, yeast, natural acidity and toasty oak. The remaining portion was fermented in stainless steel tanks, with those lots transferred to barrel once fermentation completed. While barrel fermentation promotes complexity and richness, tank fermentation maximizes fruit intensity. Partial malolactic fermentation, primarily of the higher acid lots, further enhanced the harmony of these elements. During nine months of barrel aging, the wines were frequently hand stirred to promote the integration of fruit, yeast, acid and oak, resulting in a beautifully balanced Chardonnay of elegant richness.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 90+ Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon Lot 53,Argentina,Cuyo,Mendoza,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,,$9.99,"WE’LL ADMIT IT, WE LOVE GREAT WINE…That’s why we started Ninety+ Cellars.It all started in the spring of 2009. Armed with a copy of the latest Wine Spectator, founder Kevin Mehra set out on a mission to bring higher quality wine to the market for a better price. He started calling wineries with a history of high ratings to ask if they had extra wine for sale. Some told him to get lost, but in the end, he found a handful of wineries that liked his concept. The plan was simple: we put their wine in our bottle, and sell it for less.But why would wineries want to do that?You may recall that the economy wasn’t in the best shape in 2009. Demand for wines priced more than $20 a bottle had plummeted and inventories were piling up. Rather than discount their wine and erode the value of their brand, we found that wineries were willing to part with a certain percentage of their production for a reduced price.It was a win/win scenario. Wineries got to sell more wine, and consumers got access to better wine at lower prices.The landscape has changed quite a bit since we launched; but our mission and our ability to offer great wine has not. With our head wine buyer, Brett Vankoski, at the helm we continue to seek out the best opportunities in the market and turn those into great values in the bottle for you.

 Gary Farrell Pinot Noir Russian River,United States,California,Sonoma County,Pinot Noir,Still wine,$45.99,$34.99,"Our founder Gary Farrell was a passionate believer in great vineyards. Long before the Russian River Valley made its mark on the world stage, Gary was out exploring vineyards in the early 1980s to identify grapes from the most promising sites in the valley.With an uncannily prophetic eye to the future, the first wine he produced under the Gary Farrell label was a 1982 Pinot Noir sourced from what would eventually become two of the Russian River Valley’s premier vineyards: Rochioli and Allen. Planted just up the road from where he would build his winery, these sites are adjacent to each other on Westside Road and have been meticulously farmed by Joe Rochioli, Jr. for more than 40 years.The success of our wines comes down to relationships like the one we enjoy with Joe and his family. We are committed to maintaining the strong, long-term partnerships we’ve established with the owners of the iconic Russian River Valley vineyards that form the heart of our wine portfolio, including Westside Farms, Rochioli, Allen, Stiling, Hallberg and more.For the past few years, we have established new relationships with even more of our neighboring Russian River Valley growers. We’ve added exciting new vineyard sources to our portfolio including Ritchie, Bacigalupi, Pellegrini Olivet Lane Estate and Martinelli, to name just a few. Additionally, we continue to work with exceptional vineyard sites outside of the Russian River Valley to add intriguing counterpoints to our portfolio. These include newer sources like Durell Vineyard in Sonoma Valley, as well as long-standing sites such as Bradford Mountain in Dry Creek Valley and the classic Bien Nacido Vineyard of the Santa Maria Valley, both of which we have been working with for more than a decade.When selecting new sites to work with, each vineyard is critically assessed for the specific climate conditions we require. In nearly every vineyard site we work with, cool breezes and fog from the nearby Pacific Ocean blanket the vines in the mornings and evenings during the growing season, tempering summer’s heat and reducing temperatures by 35-40 degrees at night, ensuring a long, even growing season. The slow ripening process that results fully matures the fruit while maintaining healthy levels of acidity. Here in the Russian River Valley, the wide range of volcanic, sandstone and alluvial soils is favorable for Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, providing essential water drainage while retaining sufficient moisture and nutrients to nourish the vines during the appellation’s long growing season.These specific conditions yield wines boasting bright, vibrant aromas, intense, yet supple flavors and exemplary balance. Our wines display these characteristics in spades, along with a remarkable purity and elegance of varietal expression.Along with the heritage vineyards our reputation has been firmly built upon, these new vineyard sources give Winemaker Theresa Heredia an even broader palette of flavor and texture to work with in the winery.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Obsidian Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Lake County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$37.49,$27.99,"History — Searching for prime, undiscovered vineyard land in the late 1990s, the Molnar family found the land that would become Obsidian Ridge Vineyard in the not-yet-formed Red Hills appellation high on the back side of the Mayacamas Range.To Nicholas Molnar, patriarch of the Molnar family, it felt similar to finding Poseidon’s Vineyard in the southernmost section of Carneros nearly 30 years earlier — an area untested but with great potential. Geographically, however, Obsidian Ridge was the exact opposite of Poseidon’s Vineyard, whose seaside location is ideal for cool climate Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.At 2,640 feet, the site is  covered with black, glassy Obsidian rock — surely Cabernet country. So, we planted 105 acres of Bordeaux clones (including a little Rhône-based Syrah) on a piece of land that was formerly an abandoned walnut orchard. As the pictures can attest, there was quite a bit of obsidian rock to pull out. But you can’t beat the views. About the same time, other pioneer growers moved in, and now Red Hills Lake County, one of the North Coast’s newest appellations, is establishing itself as a premier Cabernet growing region.

 Jayson Pahlmeyer Red Wine Napa Valley,United States,California,Napa County,Bordeaux Blend,Still wine,$81.19,$54.99,"The Pahlmeyer story is a tale of international intrigue, passion and Hollywood stardom… Of Jayson Pahlmeyer, friends and family… Of French clones, legendary winemaking and iconic wines...Once upon a time, there was a man with a bold, irrepressible spirit - a trial attorney called to the profession by its fast and furious nature.While successful in his career, a hypnotic captivation with wine soon eclipsed his legal ambitions. He had an insatiable thirst for adventure and a certainty that Northern California (his native soil) held considerable winegrowing potential. Was it destiny that Jayson Pahlmeyer’s world was turned happily upside down? Who can say?Following his dream, Jayson partnered with the owner of a 55-acre site in south-east Napa Valley. The two shared a devotion to Jayson’s audacious dream of creating a “California Mouton,” and began imagining the vineyard’s potential. The key, they were sure, lay in planting the finest French clones of the red Bordeaux varieties - a considerable roadblock since importing clones is an international offense.After months of sleuthing in elite French vineyards, Jayson’s partner sought the assistance of the venerable viticultural professors at the University of Bordeaux. The professors analyzed soil samples, exposure, rainfall and temperature data from the land and recommended the Californians grow corn.Undaunted, Jayson and his partner persevered until after three years the professors isolated the exact Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec vines with the greatest intensity, depth of flavor and character.Jayson’s partner smuggled their “suitcase clones” to the U.S. through Canada. All went off without a hitch until their final truckload, when the border authorities uncovered the French vines. Ordered to surrender all their contraband, they kept their French clones hidden and instead turned over to the unwitting patrollers clones purchased from U.C. Davis.Planted in 1981, the French cuttings adjusted to their shock at a snail’s pace. Catching wind of these crazy guys and their Bordeaux vines, one of California’s foremost winemakers, Randy Dunn, visited the site and warned, “Don’t screw it up.” Clearly they didn’t because in 1986, seeing unparalleled promise, Randy asked to purchase the entire crop. Jayson agreed - on one condition: that Randy make Jayson’s “Pahlmeyer” Napa Valley Bordeaux blend.Anointed 94 points by Robert Parker, the first release, the 1986 Pahlmeyer Proprietary Red, launched Pahlmeyer’s astonishing track record of critical acclaim.In 1989, Jayson invited rising star winemaker Bob Levy to produce the first vintages of Pahlmeyer Chardonnay. The 1991 Chardonnay sold out immediately, giving Jayson good reason to decline a screenwriter’s request for samples to use in a Hollywood movie. In the end, though, he acquiesced, and to his great surprise, the wine’s big role in the battle-of-the-sexes blockbuster Disclosure helped further the frenzy surrounding Pahlmeyer. In 1993, Helen Turley took the winemaking reins, beginning her own rise to prominence. She and her team - including protege Erin Green - furthered the work of Dunn and Levy, improving the quality and consistency of Pahlmeyer wines through winegrowing, grape sourcing and winemaking innovation.To push quality to even greater heights, Helen urged Jayson to develop estate vineyards. She was instrumental in finding Pahlmeyer’s high-elevation Napa Valley estate vineyard, planted in 1998 to red Bordeaux varieties and Chardonnay. In that same year, a stone’s throw from her famed Marcassin Vineyard on the extreme Sonoma Coast, she found the Wayfarer estate ideally situated for growing Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Both estate vineyards were planted by viticulture legend David Abreu in 1998 and 2002, respectively.In 2012, Jayson named Bibiana Gonzalez Rave winemaker for Wayfarer, to oversee his new wines from the estate vineyard, then ten years old and perfectly poised for a solo bottling. She immediately went to work meticulously optimizing the vineyards and realizing his dream to create world class Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. In 2016, her role expanded across all of the Napa Valley operations and Pahlmeyer winemaking.Pahlmeyer’s viticultural practices demand low yields while commanding maximum flavor intensity. Farming in one- to two-acre blocks with a palette of as many as 12 clones for each variety, Pahlmeyer’s world-class pedigree of artisanal winemaking continues to rise to new heights as Bibiana pushes the envelope on clone and vineyard management, as well as cellar and winemaking equipment and practices. In 2008, Jayson’s daughter Cleo joined the team, bringing the next generation into the Pahlmeyer legacy and launching the Wayfarer brand.And so it is that vintage after vintage, Pahlmeyer continues to live up to Jayson’s audacious dream - producing phenomenal wines of power and finesse.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the world’s leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Mario’s son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Home’s original philosophy to offer ”a great product for a fair price,” even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley.

 Trentadue La Storia Petite Sirah,United States,California,Sonoma County,Petite Sirah,Still wine,$29.99,$22.99,"The Trentadue family arrived in Sonoma County long before the region gained a reputation as the Wine Country. Life-long, hands-on agriculturists, Evelyn and Leo Trentadue contributed significantly to the advancement of their region over the years. In 1959, the Trentadues decided to flee the developers encroaching on their apricot and cherry orchards in Sunnyvale, the area known today around the world as Silicon Valley. To preserve their way of life, these hard-working Italian ranchers purchased 208 acres of land in Sonoma County’s then remote Alexander Valley.There was little market for the region’s dry-farmed apples, prunes, pears, and grapes in the late 1950s, so land was cheap and plentiful. Scores of ranches were for sale but, because it was blessed with an excellent combination of climate, soil, and water, Leo settled on a special piece of property in the heart of the Alexander Valley. Little did he know what this ranch had once been, much less what it was to become.The piece of land, which is now home to Trentadue Winery, has a remarkable history. In 1868, a French botanist named Andrew Bouton established Heart’s Desire Nursery on this excellent site east of the railroad tracks. With a passion for breeding new and improved strains of fruit trees, Bouton devoted himself to plant propagation, becoming a major supplier of young tree stock to orchardists throughout the western United States. His reputation attracted the attention of a young man named Luther Burbank who visited Bouton frequently. Influenced by Bouton, Burbank conducted his own work in nearby Sebastopol and Santa Rosa.Shaping the Trentadue Estate Vineyards and WineryLeo Trentadue has a reputation for openness to new ideas. Over the years, this inveterate tinkerer has been among the first to experiment with what resulted in a number of viticultural/wine industry innovations. An overview of his unheralded achievements: From dry farming to irrigation. Horse drawn plows and dry farming were still practiced when the Trentadues arrived in the Alexander Valley. Leo introduced advanced irrigation practices common to his former home in Santa Clara County.The Trentadues were among the very first to plant new vines in Sonoma County since the days of Prohibition. Italians love their red wines, especially hearty reds like Carignane. In 1962, the Trentadue family began planting new Carignane vines in addition to the 68 acres of old vines already growing on their ranch. Now more than 115 years old, these vines are among the oldest producing Carignane vineyards in America. The family remains steadfastly devoted to this grape, and their wine ranks indisputably among just a handful of top ranked California Carignane. These vines continue to provide valuable character in many of our award winning wines.Understanding the importance of growing only those grape varieties, which excelled in his vineyards, in 1974 Leo installed half-acre blocks of eight different varietals. The quality of the Sangiovese was extraordinary, so all other vines were replanted to this famed variety from Tuscany. Because Evelyn and Leo share a Tuscan heritage, it is not surprising that in 1984 Trentadue was the first producer to release a 100% varietal wine named for this famed grape of Italy. The superior quality of this fruit has produced our most popular Tasting Room wine and has been the backbone for our La Storia Cuvee 32 blend, which is consistently one of the top wines produced from the Trentadue Estate.Leo had produced an incredible, award-winning 1973 Angelica and finally, in 1987, he encouraged his winemaker to experiment with fortified wines. An excellent Petite Sirah Port resulted, among the very first of its kind. The wine was well received, so a Merlot Port and eventually a Zinfandel Port were added to the line. Over the years, Trentadue has become the leading producer of dessert wines in the area, including the wildly popular Chocolate Amore.Connection to Ridge VineyardsThis winery’s story cannot be told without mention of the Trentadues’ remarkable long-term relationship with Paul Draper of Ridge Vineyards. Their personal history began in 1952 when the Trentadues became Paul’s neighbor in Santa Clara, after buying an old abandoned wine estate at the end of Montebello Road. Paul began buying fruit from their ancient vines, striking up a friendship which continues to this day.Both Draper and the Trentadues know a good thing when they see it. Draper was quick to benefit from the Trentadues’ aptitude for viticulture. The Trentadues have similarly benefited from Draper’s wine business savvy. Indeed, it is Draper who encouraged the family to take advantage of their location and establish an estate winery.The list of mutual benefits derived from the Trentadue and Ridge association is extensive: Fruit from the Trentadues’ Geyserville estate has been sold to Ridge Vineyards every vintage since 1967. In 1974, Ridge Vineyard acquired the Trentadues’ mountaintop winery and vineyard today known as Montebello. Victor Trentadue manages not only 99 plus acres of his family’s estate-owned fruit contracted to Ridge, but is also entrusted to manage 188 additional acres of Dry Creek Valley grapes under contract nearby to Draper.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

Full and complex, this wine has a nose that hints of pineapple, pears and sweet lemons. Tropical fruits are integrated with the zest of citrus fruits and give way to a creamy mid-palate. We achieved depth and complexity through a combination of winemaking methods. First, grapes were hand-picked, de-stemmed and crushed prior to undergoing cool fermentation in steel tanks and an extended maceration. A small portion of the wine was made with the traditional passito method: we dried harvested grapes on straw mats for several weeks, then gently pressed and fermented them before blending.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Trentadue La Storia Zinfandel,United States,California,Sonoma County,Zinfandel,Still wine,,$23.99,"The Trentadue family arrived in Sonoma County long before the region gained a reputation as the Wine Country. Life-long, hands-on agriculturists, Evelyn and Leo Trentadue contributed significantly to the advancement of their region over the years. In 1959, the Trentadues decided to flee the developers encroaching on their apricot and cherry orchards in Sunnyvale, the area known today around the world as Silicon Valley. To preserve their way of life, these hard-working Italian ranchers purchased 208 acres of land in Sonoma County’s then remote Alexander Valley.There was little market for the region’s dry-farmed apples, prunes, pears, and grapes in the late 1950s, so land was cheap and plentiful. Scores of ranches were for sale but, because it was blessed with an excellent combination of climate, soil, and water, Leo settled on a special piece of property in the heart of the Alexander Valley. Little did he know what this ranch had once been, much less what it was to become.The piece of land, which is now home to Trentadue Winery, has a remarkable history. In 1868, a French botanist named Andrew Bouton established Heart’s Desire Nursery on this excellent site east of the railroad tracks. With a passion for breeding new and improved strains of fruit trees, Bouton devoted himself to plant propagation, becoming a major supplier of young tree stock to orchardists throughout the western United States. His reputation attracted the attention of a young man named Luther Burbank who visited Bouton frequently. Influenced by Bouton, Burbank conducted his own work in nearby Sebastopol and Santa Rosa.Shaping the Trentadue Estate Vineyards and WineryLeo Trentadue has a reputation for openness to new ideas. Over the years, this inveterate tinkerer has been among the first to experiment with what resulted in a number of viticultural/wine industry innovations. An overview of his unheralded achievements: From dry farming to irrigation. Horse drawn plows and dry farming were still practiced when the Trentadues arrived in the Alexander Valley. Leo introduced advanced irrigation practices common to his former home in Santa Clara County.The Trentadues were among the very first to plant new vines in Sonoma County since the days of Prohibition. Italians love their red wines, especially hearty reds like Carignane. In 1962, the Trentadue family began planting new Carignane vines in addition to the 68 acres of old vines already growing on their ranch. Now more than 115 years old, these vines are among the oldest producing Carignane vineyards in America. The family remains steadfastly devoted to this grape, and their wine ranks indisputably among just a handful of top ranked California Carignane. These vines continue to provide valuable character in many of our award winning wines.Understanding the importance of growing only those grape varieties, which excelled in his vineyards, in 1974 Leo installed half-acre blocks of eight different varietals. The quality of the Sangiovese was extraordinary, so all other vines were replanted to this famed variety from Tuscany. Because Evelyn and Leo share a Tuscan heritage, it is not surprising that in 1984 Trentadue was the first producer to release a 100% varietal wine named for this famed grape of Italy. The superior quality of this fruit has produced our most popular Tasting Room wine and has been the backbone for our La Storia Cuvee 32 blend, which is consistently one of the top wines produced from the Trentadue Estate.Leo had produced an incredible, award-winning 1973 Angelica and finally, in 1987, he encouraged his winemaker to experiment with fortified wines. An excellent Petite Sirah Port resulted, among the very first of its kind. The wine was well received, so a Merlot Port and eventually a Zinfandel Port were added to the line. Over the years, Trentadue has become the leading producer of dessert wines in the area, including the wildly popular Chocolate Amore.Connection to Ridge VineyardsThis winery’s story cannot be told without mention of the Trentadues’ remarkable long-term relationship with Paul Draper of Ridge Vineyards. Their personal history began in 1952 when the Trentadues became Paul’s neighbor in Santa Clara, after buying an old abandoned wine estate at the end of Montebello Road. Paul began buying fruit from their ancient vines, striking up a friendship which continues to this day.Both Draper and the Trentadues know a good thing when they see it. Draper was quick to benefit from the Trentadues’ aptitude for viticulture. The Trentadues have similarly benefited from Draper’s wine business savvy. Indeed, it is Draper who encouraged the family to take advantage of their location and establish an estate winery.The list of mutual benefits derived from the Trentadue and Ridge association is extensive: Fruit from the Trentadues’ Geyserville estate has been sold to Ridge Vineyards every vintage since 1967. In 1974, Ridge Vineyard acquired the Trentadues’ mountaintop winery and vineyard today known as Montebello. Victor Trentadue manages not only 99 plus acres of his family’s estate-owned fruit contracted to Ridge, but is also entrusted to manage 188 additional acres of Dry Creek Valley grapes under contract nearby to Draper.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Duck Pond Pinot Noir Willamette Vally,United States,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Still wine,$21.99,$19.99,"In an era of significant corporate ownership in the Northwest wine industry, our wineries and vineyards remain a close-knit family operation run by two generations of a Northwest farming family. Originally from California’s Central Valley, lifelong farmers Doug and Jo Ann Fries (pronounced “Frees”) moved their young family to the Northwest in the early 1980s. In 1984, they purchased property along the banks of the Willamette River in Dundee, Oregon, where they planted a 500-acre hazelnut orchard. As devoted wine aficionados, they also planted a small 13-acre vineyard with the hope of producing a few hundred cases of their own wine. On Memorial Day Weekend of 1993, the family opened the doors to their first winery venture, Duck Pond Cellars, in Dundee, Oregon. The tasting room was run by Doug and Jo Ann’s daughter Lisa; son Greg took over winemaking after earning his enology degree from UC Davis in 1994. Over the past two decades, the family has grown the brand into one of the leading producers of Oregon Pinot Noir and Pinot Gris. The Fries family has always been passionate about full-bodied red wines such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah. This love prompted their 1992 acquisition of a 540-acre parcel of land on Eastern Washington’s Wahluke Slope, an area particularly suited to growing hot-climate varietals. The family dubbed the site Desert Wind Vineyard and spent three years planting Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and a handful of other varieties. In 2001, they launched the Desert Wind brand to showcase their handcrafted wines from these vineyard sites. The Desert Wind facility in Prosser, Washington, is a destination unto itself. Perched on a bluff overlooking the Yakima River, its Southwest-inspired exterior houses a tasting room, event space, restaurant area and four overnight guest rooms. Ever the hard workers, family members were very involved throughout the entire process of designing and building the facility. Today the family remains active in all winery operations. Although they say they are semi-retired, Doug and Jo Ann oversee much of the vineyard operations, often putting in long hours during the growing season. Son Greg is president of the company and oversees the winemaking team, cellar crew and vineyard workers. His wife Amber serves as director of communications, handling print and interactive media as well as the company’s extensive charitable giving program. Vice President Lisa (Fries) Jenkins manages day-to-day winery operations. Her husband Scott is vice president of sales, spending much of his time on the road representing the family’s wines. Erin Fries handles purchasing and merchandising for the retail shop/tasting rooms",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Craggy Range Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Wairarapa,Martinborough,Sauvignon Blanc,Still wine,$23.99,$18.99,"Craggy Range's Te Muna Road vineyard, in the Martinborough district at the south end of the North Island, is an exceptional estate unique in New Zealand. The property is divided into two terraces: an upper terrace lying entirely on the old, stony, decomposing Martinborough soils well suited to Pinot Noir; and a geologically distinct lower terrace dominated by classic New Zealand greywacke stones, a superb terrior for Sauvignon Blanc. This sheltered lower terrace, along the Huangarua River, is the former bed of this river and its deep, stony soils are interspersed with layers of sand, silt and clay. There are also significant deposits of limestone pebbles that have eroded from the adjacent hills over time. The majority of the vineyard's fourteen Sauvignon Blanc parcels, totaling 130 acres, are situated on the lower terrace.At harvest in early to mid-April, when the fruit has achieved 21º to 24º brix, each of the eleven parcels are gathered, the majority by hand, and most maintained separately throughout the fermentation process. The hand-picked grapes are chilled to 45(F overnight and then gently whole cluster pressed before cold settling. The machine-harvested parcels are picked when cool, early in the morning, and similarly pressed. All pressings are eliminated at this stage. The clear free-run juice is slowly cold-fermented partly with indigenous and partly with selected yeasts, and depending on the harvest, ten to twelve percent of the wine is barrel fermented with the balance vinified in stainless steel. The wine then spends two to four months on the fine lees. After a selection of the best parcels the wine is blended, gently fined and bottled in September.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the world’s leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Mario’s son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Home’s original philosophy to offer ”a great product for a fair price,” even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites.

 90+ Cellars Rose Languedoc Lot 33,France,Languedoc Roussillon,Languedoc,Red Rhone Blend,Still wine,,$9.99,"WE’LL ADMIT IT, WE LOVE GREAT WINE…That’s why we started Ninety+ Cellars.It all started in the spring of 2009. Armed with a copy of the latest Wine Spectator, founder Kevin Mehra set out on a mission to bring higher quality wine to the market for a better price. He started calling wineries with a history of high ratings to ask if they had extra wine for sale. Some told him to get lost, but in the end, he found a handful of wineries that liked his concept. The plan was simple: we put their wine in our bottle, and sell it for less.But why would wineries want to do that?You may recall that the economy wasn’t in the best shape in 2009. Demand for wines priced more than $20 a bottle had plummeted and inventories were piling up. Rather than discount their wine and erode the value of their brand, we found that wineries were willing to part with a certain percentage of their production for a reduced price.It was a win/win scenario. Wineries got to sell more wine, and consumers got access to better wine at lower prices.The landscape has changed quite a bit since we launched; but our mission and our ability to offer great wine has not. With our head wine buyer, Brett Vankoski, at the helm we continue to seek out the best opportunities in the market and turn those into great values in the bottle for you. We do this because we love great wine, and we know you do too.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Coppola Diamond Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,N/A,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$17.99,$14.97,"”I’ve always been influenced by the idea of Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, which was the inspiration for ultimately all modern amusements parks. I remember the beautiful theater pavilions with the curtains painted with peacock feathers that had little ballet performances. At Tivoli, there were rides, but more important than the rides were the cafes and the refreshments, and just the sense of being in a children’s garden, a ‘pleasure garden’ for all people to enjoy - which perhaps is the best phrase to describe what we’re creating here. This vision was replicated at places on Coney Island, like Luna Park, and George C. Tilyou’s Steeplechase Park, or Palisades Park. These were basically wonderlands, and I thought Francis Ford Coppola Winery could become such a park for the family to go and enjoy, where there are things for kids to do, so they can be close to their parents who are sampling wines and foods.I’ve often felt that modern life tends to separate all the ages too much. In the old days, the children lived with the parents and the grandparents, and the family unit each gave one another something very valuable. So when we began to develop the idea for this winery, we thought it should be like a resort, basically a wine wonderland, a park of pleasure where people of all ages can enjoy the best things in life - food, wine, music, dancing, games, swimming and performances of all types. A place to celebrate the love of life.”- Francis Ford CoppolaFor more than thirty years, we have been committed to environmentally responsible business practices. It’s been our goal to minimize our impact on the environment by seeking out innovative ways to produce and package our goods.At Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all 24 planted acres are sustainably farmed and part of the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program. We try to purchase fruit from growers who farm sustainably, and some of the vineyards we source from are certified organic as well. Another benefit of participating in the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program is that we have subsequently become a learning-teaching vineyard. Every technique we implement is thoroughly documented so that we, and neighboring Sonoma winegrowers, can pinpoint the best ways to protect our land and craft the best wines from these vineyards.We are also actively involved in the Fish Friendly Farming certification program. While this may seem like a matter totally unrelated to wine, watershed quality management is intrinsically connected to farming our vineyard because our property includes two blue-line creeks. These creeks are a part of the Russian River watershed that supports steelhead trout and Coho salmon populations. In conjunction with our neighbors and local, state, and federal agencies, we work diligently to promote the overall health of the Russian River watershed so that the entire ecosystem remains in balance and is preserved for generations to come.Our winegrowing practices involve the Integrated Pest Management program, which discusses the best practices for maintaining soil and vine health and proactively farming to reduce and treat pest pressures. Field experts provide monthly lectures concerning pest problems and solutions which we implement in our vineyard. Through our integrated pest management program, we have complemented the biodiversity of our vineyard by promoting the presence of beneficial insects, soil fauna, and owls that combat pests of grapevines.Finally, we recycle our grape and water waste by fertilizing with composted grape pomace and irrigating only with reclaimed winery wastewater.  In effect, we have closed the loop on our waste system in an effort to reduce our carbon footprint on the land we so love.Outside of the vineyard, our Francis Coppola Diamond Collection wines are packaged in 100% recycled cardboard case boxes, and all of the corks we purchase come from sustainable cork forests. Additionally, we insist that the label and foil companies we do business with have environmentally friendly practices as well.During the reconstruction of Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all of the crews, vendors, and sub-contractors we hired were local residents, helping to cut down on transportation costs, as well as supporting the economy of our community.Rather than use new lumber for the construction, we reused the wood from the Redwood trees that were removed from the courtyard area. Some of this timber was used to build the main reception desk in the Guest Services building, while other portions has been used to build the outdoor dining tables. The pyramid skylights in our towers feature an environmentally friendly material called Kalwall to construct skylights. This material diffuses light in such a way that little artificial lighting is needed, which helps conserve energy.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Sterling Vineyard Vinters Collection Pinot Noir,United States,California,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Still wine,$14.99,$10.99,"We sourced the majority of our Pinot Noir from Edna Valley, which we like for its distinctively cool climate, ideal for this varietal. Near the town of San Luis Obispo, this valley has a unique east–west alignment that allows fog to funnel in from the Pacific. This results in temperate days and a long growing season, producing Pinot Noir with ripe tannins and aromatic black-cherry notes. The fruit from Monterey carries a more brambly minerality, adding balance and complexity.One of the most difficult wines to make, Pinot Noir is fickle and demanding, requiring delicate handling and careful attention. After the fruit was harvested and brought to the winery, it was allowed a three-day cold soak, which prevented the onset of fermentation and allowed the gentle extraction of bright fruit flavors and dark colors. We then fermented the wine in stainless steel tanks, incorporating the skins and juice with regular pump-over. To knit together the flavors and impart complexity and structure, we barrel aged the wine for seven months.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"
 Senor Sangria Red,United States,New York,Hudson Valley,Non-Varietal Red Blend,Still wine,$10.79,$8.99,"In 1810, a French Huguenot emigre named Jean Jaques purchased land in New York’s bucolic Hudson Valley and began planting grapes. By 1837, Mr. Jaques needed more land, so he purchased a plot in the quiet village of Washingtonville, NY, and planted another vineyard. By 1839, his first underground cellars were dug and Mr. Jaques fermented his first wine vintage. Those cellars, the oldest and largest in America, are still in use today at Brotherhood Winery.The Jaques family made wine at the Washingtonville facility for almost 60 years, selling much of it to Jesse and Edward Emerson, two New York City wine merchants. The Emersons, Finger Lakes vinters themselves, understood the high quality of Mr. Jaques’ wine and used it to improve a blend of wine from an organization called The Brotherhood of New Life - an experiment in utopian communal living in the Hudson Valley. When the Emerson family took control of the Washingtonville winery, they renamed it Brotherhood, a name that it still proudly bears today.The Emerson family operated Brotherhood until Prohibition. In 1921, Louis Farrell purchased the winery and its large stock of sacramental wine. He sold wine for religious ceremonies throughout Prohibition, which was finally repealed in 1933. It has been noted that the clergy population in the area grew substantially during this period.Louis and his wife were the first to grasp the value of Brotherhood’s location, as the nearest winery to New York City. They began conducting tours of the winery, highlighting the now-enlarged underground cellars, the history of the facility and its picturesque site. In fact, the Farrell family initiated the very concept of wine tourism, hosting parties and events at the winery that drew hundreds of thousands of fans annually, and introduced the Brotherhood brand to generations of American drinkers.A partnership of businessmen purchased the winery in 1987, including a prominent winemaker from Chile, Mr. Cesar Baeza. Baeza, internationally recognized as a master blender, wine educator and winery consultant, set about creating premium New York varietal wines and converting Brotherhood into a premier destination in NY State.After a disastrous fire in 1999, Brotherhood’s fortunes suffered until 2005, when Mr. Baeza formed a new partnership with two winemaking families from Chile. The Castro and Chadwick families have deep roots in the famous winegrowing areas of the Maule Valley, near San Clemente, where they farm hundreds of acres of Vinifera grapes, along with other fruit.The new Board of Directors has embarked on a massive restoration and renovation program at Brotherhood that includes equipment upgrades, vineyard acquisitions, the planting of new vines and a facility remodeling, highlighting the partners’ commitment to improving quality.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

In the world of fine wines, a unique combination of quality, reliability and value since 1977. The label belongs to Neil and Maria Empson, who launched the Super Tuscan five years after founding Neil Empson Selections. It was their special affinity to the heartland of Italy that led them to make their very own mark on Tuscan soil: with the Maestro of Italian winemakers, Franco Bernabei, they have styled the Tuscan grape per eccellenza and expressed its ultimate potential, complementing it with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.The wine itself comes from a few of the region’s finest vineyard sites, in the areas of Maremma, Colline Pisane, and Colli Fiorentini. Soil type goes from compact, including a very fine-textured limestone at 1,300-1,500 feet a.s.l, a classic, clayey/calcareous, rocky galestro also at altitudes around 1,300 feet, and clayey/siliceous/calcareous soil at an altitude of 820-990 feet. The finest selections are cherry-picked according to harvest conditions in the individual terroirs and microclimates. This balanced orchestration of geological diversity makes for the wine’s consistent excellence.The superlative characteristics of chosen locations and strict quality parameters make for the wine’s depth, structure, character, and longevity. A cross-section of Tuscany’s best. Monte Antico is an ideal match to pasta, meat, fowl, and cheese.

 Erath Pinot Noir,United States,Oregon,N/A,Pinot Noir,Still wine,$21.59,$15.99,"Erath wines are an expression of the land that the winery has cultivated for more than 40 years, longer than any other winery in the Dundee Hills of Oregon. The red, iron-rich Jory soils, combined with gentle breezes and warming sunshine of a marine climate, have bestowed upon Dundee a terroir of note. It has given rise to the handcrafting phenomenon, and the art of Pinot.As one of Oregon’s wine pioneers, Dick Erath had always been as tenacious in his approach to Pinot as the Pinot grape is stubborn. The engineer-turned-viticulturist was first inspired to pursue winemaking in 1965 after an early garage experiment. After completing coursework at UC-Davis in 1968, Erath relocated his family from California to the untamed red hills of Dundee. An unheated logger’s cabin on 49 acres would serve as home – and ad hoc winery – for several years.The following spring, he planted the Dundee Hill’s first wine grapes – 23 varieties. Pinot Noir flourished.By 1972, Erath had produced his first commercial wine of 216 cases – the first official wine production in the Dundee Hills. Enchanted with French varietals, he soon began testing non-California clones and was instrumental in importing French clones to Oregon in 1974.In 1976, Erath broke ground on the first winery in the Dundee Hills. Early successes, including the 1982 Pinot Noir vintage, inspired leading winemakers to move to Oregon to forge their own path in this special place.Disciplined in approach yet progressive in artistry, our winemaker Gary Horner, strives to reveal classic Oregon Pinot: light, delicate and fruit-forward.Gary’s goal of “making the best Pinot Noir the region has to offer – time honored, authentic and uniquely Oregon” is matched by his reputation of excellence.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

Some people think it goes back to the 1930s and the origins of commercial winemaking in California, when people would gather for a grape stomp and carry the fresh juice home. Others think it’s all about the convenience of the ring, the simple loop that makes it easy to carry, pour and share your favorite wine.

Cantine Leonardo is situated in the borough of Vinci, just five kilometres from the birthplace of the world famous artist and inventor Leonardo.The co-operative takes its name from the great man, paying homage to the mind of the man who was universally recognised as a genius and to emphasise its deep-rooted bond with the territory, the same bond which Leonardo felt and whose surname is specifically associated with the village where he was born on 15 April 1452.Today, Cantine Leonardo da Vinci is a pioneering co-operative, innovative and modern, which relies on the work and grape production of its 160 members.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"
 Silverado Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$61.79,$49.99,"“The beginning of vine planting is like the beginning of mining for precious metals: the winegrower also ‘prospects’.” - Robert Louis Stevenson, The Silverado Squatters, 1880A century later, the Miller family began the journey Stevenson described, establishing Silverado Vineyards in 1981. “It was beautiful land, and it was land that was working,” says Diane Miller of their first vineyards, purchased in the 1970s. Diane and Ron sold their grapes to some of Napa’s best vintners, who made award winning wines from them year after year. Encouraged, they struck out on their own with the goal of making the best wines the estate could produce at a fair price. This has remained the guiding philosophy over the years. The winery’s name, Silverado, comes from the abandoned mining town at the top of the Napa Valley, where Stevenson stayed so many years ago. It is an appropriate symbol: three generations of the Miller family are still “prospecting” for wine, staying true to the idea of coaxing something precious from the soils we are privileged to care for.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Baron Herzog White Zinfandel,United States,California,N/A,Zinfandel,Still wine,,$8.99,"The Jewish people have a special relationship to wine that predates even the Romans and Greeks. For the ancient Jews, whose temple in Jerusalem was renowned throughout the fledgling civilizations of the Middle East, wine played an important role in religious ritual. Today, thousands of years later, it continues to do so. Kiddush, the prayer over the wine, traditionally announces the beginning of the Sabbath on Friday night as well as other holidays.And so it should come as no surprise that the Herzog family has been making wine for a long time. They trace their winemaking origins back to Philip Herzog, who made wine in Slovakia for the Austro-Hungarian court more than a century ago. Philip’s wines were so appreciated by Emperor Franz-Josef, that the emperor made Philip a baron. The Baron Herzog wines-a line of premium yet moderately priced California varietals-are named to commemorate the honor.Baron Philip made both kosher and non-kosher wines. The kosher wines were made in a separate cellar and tasted remarkably like his non-kosher wines. Indeed, the wines were made in the same basic manner. However, the kosher wines required a Jewish, Sabbath-observant cellar crew.During World War II, Philip’s grandson Eugene hid his family from the Nazis by moving them around the Slovakian countryside. After the war’s end, he emerged from behind a false wall in a courageous Christian friend’s woodshed to reclaim his family’s winery.But three years later, the new Czech communist regime drove the Herzogs away from their European home for good. Forced to leave with little more than the clothes on their backs, the family said goodbye to their former royal economic and social stature.Eugene brought the family to America in 1948 after the Holocaust.  He arrived in New York City with his wife, Sidonia, six of his own children and two additional war orphans. They moved to the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn with only enough money to rent a two-bedroom tenement flat. With his winemaking skills, Eugene found a job at a small kosher winery tucked away into a storefront on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. For a paltry salary, he made sweet, Concord-grape wines in the cellar. (European grape varieties for dry wines were not easy to obtain in post World War II New York.) He also drove the wine delivery truck. But because the company was so poor, he was paid for his driving acumen in company shares, not cash.For years the shares were worthless, but by 1958, all the other shareholders had given up their shares. They assumed the business was doomed to failure. Eugene and his sons, who all went to work at the winery, proved them wrong. They called their new venture Royal Wines, in deference to their grandfather, Philip.In 1985, the Herzog family decided to expand their winemaking operations to California, where they make wine under two separate labels: Baron Herzog and Herzog Wine Cellars. After twenty years of renting space in various wineries, the family was finally able to build its own state-of-the-art winery just south of Santa Barbara, in the town of Oxnard. Here, under the supervision of head winemaker Joe Hurliman, Herzog Wine Cellars has created a center for high-end contemporary winemaking in a tradition that dates back nearly six centuries.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Vampire Pinot Noir,United States,California,N/A,Pinot Noir,Still wine,$12.19,$9.99,"The year was 1985, and it was pitch dark on a rural highway somewhere in the Nevada desert.  The only visible lights were the stars up above, when Michael Machat first saw the vision  across the sky.  The image was red wine, and the name was Vampire. Some 3000 miles later Machat emerged in NY eager to share what, he thought, was a brilliant idea.  Unfortunately the reaction from the wine trade was  disbelief.  “A wine named Vampire?  What was this young New York lawyer thinking?” At that time the notion of calling a  wine Vampire®, let alone describing it as the Blood of the Vine!® was downright silly if not irreverent.  Wine was meant to be taken seriously; it wasn’t meant for playing games.Not perturbed by the skeptics, the idea stayed with him.   Transylvania was the logical choice, but at the time it was ruled by the communist dictator Ceausescu, and marketing was illegal.   They too weren’t interested in Machat’s ideas.  But the power of the vision stayed with him.Later that year music/trademark attorney, Michael Machat, visited  London for what was supposed to be a four week business trip.  It was here that he met the girl who would become the future Countess to Vampire wines, and his wife to this day - British beauty musician/writer Lisa Dominique.  Michael’s one month stay in England lasted 7 years and in 1990, Michael married English rock star Lisa Dominique.While representing artists in England, Machat didn’t give up on his vision.   Since Transylvania wasn’t an option, he began elsewhere.  In 1988, while living in London, he released the first Vampire wine, a full bodied Algerian Syrah bottled in France.   Next was an Italian Sangiovese, which found its way back home to the Anne Rice Fan Club in New Orleans.It wasn’t until 1990 when the Berlin Wall was torn down and the Romanian people executed their leader that Michael began his early trips to Transylvania seeking a winery for his concept. It wasn’t easy. Marketing had been unlawful for 45 years and the Romanians had no appreciation for the western world’s notion of a vampire. Many vintners were too proud to allow Machat to brand their wine as he envisioned. They had a different understanding of vampires, and convincing them that the idea would work was surprisingly not simple.In 1995, one decade after that road trip, Michael brought his  vision to life. He had at long last found a home for his idea in Transylvania.  From the soil and roots of the legendary Count Dracula, Vampire had arisen and the true blood of the vine was born.Over two decades have passed since that first production of Vampire wine in Transylvania, and we are proud to say it has been a wonderful journey of making our wines the best that they can be.  Along the way, both Michael and Lisa’s palates matured. They began demanding better and better wine for their Vampire Brand.So in 2007, the Machat family uprooted their connections in Transylvania and moved their wine production to California where they reside. The first California production was produced in Paso Robles. The following year the Machats began expanding the Vampire range, adding  Dracula and Trueblood to their upper range of wines.With an unyielding thirst for even more distinctive and sophisticated wines, the Machats established a winery up in Napa where they produce Cabernet Sauvignon,  Pinot Noir, and Chardonnay. In May 2014, their Trueblood Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon won a Gold Medal and scored 90 Points at the Los Angeles International Wine and Spirits Competition.In 2011 the Countess Lisa Dominique designed and opened up the Vampire Lounge & Tasting Room in Beverly Hills.  The venue has become a favorite of many to hang out and relax over a glass of wine.  (The staff are discreet as would be expected in a place haunted by entertainment personalities. )n 2014, the Countess Lisa also proudly released her first Vampire novel, “A Walk in the Sun” - a Vampire Vineyards publication.  The book has garnered great reviews and has been compared to the classic Bram Stoker’s Dracula by Kirkus Reviews.Whatever the Machat “Vampire Vineyards’ Family share and produce, they surround it with a passion that reveals their love for what they do.  Be it their range of award winning wines, their delicious fine Vampire Belgian chocolates or their eclectic Vampire Coffees, or maybe just a cozy night by the fire reading “A Walk in the Sun” whilst sipping the blood of the Vine!  It’s what they love to do.  It is their passion, and that passion is something they feel blessed to be able to share with you.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Cakebread Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$89.99,$69.99,"The grapes are hand harvested, destemmed and immediately crushed, and each vineyard lot is fermented separately with selected yeasts in temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks over a period of six to seven days. Each lot of grapes is frequently tasted during fermentation to determine when the extraction is at optimum. At that point, the wine is pressed off the skins in membrane wine presses, keeping the press wine separate from the free-run wine. In this way, Cakebread Cellars' red wines, especially the Cabernets, have their natural fruitiness preserved, while the extraction of harsh, drying tannins is avoided. It is then pressed and returned to stainless steel for complete malolactic fermentation. Following this, the wine is racked into French oak barrels, of which roughly half are new and half of one and two years' use for approximately six months.Throughout the initial aging process, the various individual lots are continually taste-analyzed to determine the final blend. Depending on the vintage, the finished blend will include up to twenty five percent combined Merlot and Cabernet Franc, with Merlot contributing the greater percentage. Once the final blend is assembled, it is returned to the same French oak barrels to age for an additional 12 to 18 months before being bottled.

 Senor Sangria White,United States,New York,Hudson Valley,Non-Varietal White Blend,Still wine,$16.99,$12.99,"In 1810, a French Huguenot emigre named Jean Jaques purchased land in New York’s bucolic Hudson Valley and began planting grapes. By 1837, Mr. Jaques needed more land, so he purchased a plot in the quiet village of Washingtonville, NY, and planted another vineyard. By 1839, his first underground cellars were dug and Mr. Jaques fermented his first wine vintage. Those cellars, the oldest and largest in America, are still in use today at Brotherhood Winery.The Jaques family made wine at the Washingtonville facility for almost 60 years, selling much of it to Jesse and Edward Emerson, two New York City wine merchants. The Emersons, Finger Lakes vinters themselves, understood the high quality of Mr. Jaques’ wine and used it to improve a blend of wine from an organization called The Brotherhood of New Life - an experiment in utopian communal living in the Hudson Valley. When the Emerson family took control of the Washingtonville winery, they renamed it Brotherhood, a name that it still proudly bears today.The Emerson family operated Brotherhood until Prohibition. In 1921, Louis Farrell purchased the winery and its large stock of sacramental wine. He sold wine for religious ceremonies throughout Prohibition, which was finally repealed in 1933. It has been noted that the clergy population in the area grew substantially during this period.Louis and his wife were the first to grasp the value of Brotherhood’s location, as the nearest winery to New York City. They began conducting tours of the winery, highlighting the now-enlarged underground cellars, the history of the facility and its picturesque site. In fact, the Farrell family initiated the very concept of wine tourism, hosting parties and events at the winery that drew hundreds of thousands of fans annually, and introduced the Brotherhood brand to generations of American drinkers.A partnership of businessmen purchased the winery in 1987, including a prominent winemaker from Chile, Mr. Cesar Baeza. Baeza, internationally recognized as a master blender, wine educator and winery consultant, set about creating premium New York varietal wines and converting Brotherhood into a premier destination in NY State.After a disastrous fire in 1999, Brotherhood’s fortunes suffered until 2005, when Mr. Baeza formed a new partnership with two winemaking families from Chile. The Castro and Chadwick families have deep roots in the famous winegrowing areas of the Maule Valley, near San Clemente, where they farm hundreds of acres of Vinifera grapes, along with other fruit.The new Board of Directors has embarked on a massive restoration and renovation program at Brotherhood that includes equipment upgrades, vineyard acquisitions, the planting of new vines and a facility remodeling, highlighting the partners’ commitment to improving quality.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Brotherhood Riesling,United States,New York,Hudson Valley,Riesling,Still wine,,$10.99,"In 1810, a French Huguenot emigre named Jean Jaques purchased land in New York’s bucolic Hudson Valley and began planting grapes. By 1837, Mr. Jaques needed more land, so he purchased a plot in the quiet village of Washingtonville, NY, and planted another vineyard. By 1839, his first underground cellars were dug and Mr. Jaques fermented his first wine vintage. Those cellars, the oldest and largest in America, are still in use today at Brotherhood Winery.The Jaques family made wine at the Washingtonville facility for almost 60 years, selling much of it to Jesse and Edward Emerson, two New York City wine merchants. The Emersons, Finger Lakes vinters themselves, understood the high quality of Mr. Jaques’ wine and used it to improve a blend of wine from an organization called The Brotherhood of New Life - an experiment in utopian communal living in the Hudson Valley. When the Emerson family took control of the Washingtonville winery, they renamed it Brotherhood, a name that it still proudly bears today.The Emerson family operated Brotherhood until Prohibition. In 1921, Louis Farrell purchased the winery and its large stock of sacramental wine. He sold wine for religious ceremonies throughout Prohibition, which was finally repealed in 1933. It has been noted that the clergy population in the area grew substantially during this period.Louis and his wife were the first to grasp the value of Brotherhood’s location, as the nearest winery to New York City. They began conducting tours of the winery, highlighting the now-enlarged underground cellars, the history of the facility and its picturesque site. In fact, the Farrell family initiated the very concept of wine tourism, hosting parties and events at the winery that drew hundreds of thousands of fans annually, and introduced the Brotherhood brand to generations of American drinkers.A partnership of businessmen purchased the winery in 1987, including a prominent winemaker from Chile, Mr. Cesar Baeza. Baeza, internationally recognized as a master blender, wine educator and winery consultant, set about creating premium New York varietal wines and converting Brotherhood into a premier destination in NY State.After a disastrous fire in 1999, Brotherhood’s fortunes suffered until 2005, when Mr. Baeza formed a new partnership with two winemaking families from Chile. The Castro and Chadwick families have deep roots in the famous winegrowing areas of the Maule Valley, near San Clemente, where they farm hundreds of acres of Vinifera grapes, along with other fruit.The new Board of Directors has embarked on a massive restoration and renovation program at Brotherhood that includes equipment upgrades, vineyard acquisitions, the planting of new vines and a facility remodeling, highlighting the partners’ commitment to improving quality.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"
 Joel Gott Pinot Gris,United States,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris,Still wine,$18.19,$13.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the world’s leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Mario’s son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Home’s original philosophy to offer ”a great product for a fair price,” even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Bread & Butter Chardonnay,United States,California,N/A,Chardonnay,Still wine,$15.99,$11.99,"This is the BREAD.The use of wood barrels for wine began thousands of years ago for storage purposes, replacing clay vessels. Wood barrels were stronger and easier to move, but originally, they did not have a specific winemaking role.  Over time, it became apparent that aging wine in wood produced positive effects in the flavor, texture, and aroma of wine. Today, oak treatment is one of the most important tools in the winemaking process.Aging wine in oak barrels allows for moderate oxidation and evaporation of the wine, which lowers astringency and increases complexity and concentration in the wine. The complex chemical compounds in oak wood impart flavors and aromas to the wine that include toast, vanilla, tea, and nuttiness. These are flavors that we connect with bread or baked goods, like pie crust and biscuits.  If you can imagine the difference between a spoon full of jam vs. that same jam spread over a warm slice of toast, you can imagine how oak flavors and aromas can enhance the experience of a wine.Oak sources can be as specific as coming from a particular forest, but in general, we look to French oak for silkier textures and spicier characters.  Eastern European countries such as Hungary, Croatia, and Russia offer similar varieties of oak, but each source offers different results of spice, nuttiness, texture in the wine. We look to American oak for stronger influences of vanilla and coconut with creamier textures.  Bread & Butter Chardonnay and Pinot Noir are aged in a combination of French, American, and East European oak, ranging from new to 4 years old. We also utilize multiple cooperages, typically at a medium toast level, but continue to experiment with different oak sources, treatments, and technologies. Our goal is to continually improve enjoyment while maintaining an accessible price for our customers.  Much like a spice rack, the age of the oak, the type of oak, the level of toasting, the cooper, and even the way the wood was harvested or cut has an effect on the flavors and aromas in the wine.  None of that matters though if the wine is not delicious for the price that one pays, so as with all things, balance is the objective.Bread & Butter Riesling does not see any oak.This is the BUTTER.Malolactic fermentation, or MLF, is the process by which we convert malic acid to lactic acid. The process increases stability of the wine but it also takes harsh, tart malic acid (think green apples) and converts it to softer, richer lactic acid (think cream and butter).  The determining factors in buttery character are directly related to 3 key factors: type, temperature, and timing.Type: While some grapes are more likely to have naturally higher levels of malic acid, the type of climate in which they are grown is a stronger determining factor.  Grapes grown in cooler climates tend to have considerably higher levels of malic acid, while grapes grown in warmer climates have lower levels. Through the process of MFL, the amount of lactic acid produced is about half the amount of malic acid with which it began. For instance, if you start with 4 g/l of malic acid, after 100% MFL, the wine will have roughly 2 g/l of lactic acid.  A higher level of malic acid should convert to more lactic acid, thus producing more butter flavors and aromas.Temperature:  Similarly, the temperature at which we ferment the grapes will also affect the amount of buttery character in the wine. A higher temperature will produce less buttery character, while a cold fermentation will add a lot of butter flavor and aroma.Timing: When MFL is introduced has a major bearing on it’s effects on the wine.  The introduction of MFL during the primary fermentation of a wine will decrease the buttery character.  This is because the yeast that is feeding on sugar, starts feeding on the lactic acid that is being produced, which decreasing the lactic acid levels in the finished wine.  If that same wine undergoes MFL after the primary fermentation will have a higher level of lactic acid, and thus increased buttery characters.Bread & Butter Chardonnay and Pinot Noir are examples of wines that benefited from cool climate growing regions, cold fermentations, and post-primary fermentation MLF. Thus our wines present very smooth and rich, without harsh acids or sharp textures.  Bread & Butter Riesling sees no malolactic fermentation, but acid levels are balanced with sugar.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Charles Smith Kungfu Girl Riesling,United States,Washington,N/A,Riesling,Still wine,$11.99,$9.97,"Growing up just outside of Sacramento, California, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Charles Smith began craving worldly travel at a young age due to his Welsh mother and French father. As soon as he had the chance, Charles decided to move to Denmark (for a “hot piece of a** i.e. a lady friend he met in the states). While in Scandinavia, Charles spent the next nine years managing rock bands and concert tours throughout Europe, including the famed Danish duo, The Ravonettes. Wining and dining while on the road became a catalyst for his passion of wine, which ultimately triggered the career he has today.In 1999, he moved back to the United States, specifically to the Pacific Northwest, opening a wine shop on Bainbridge Island, just across the Puget Sound from downtown Seattle. On a road trip in late 1999, he passed through the small town of Walla Walla and met a young Frenchman and winemaker. The two men discovered their common passion for great Syrah and Charles was eventually convinced to move to Walla Walla and make his own juice. In 2001, Charles released 330 cases of his first wine, the 1999 K Syrah. The Walla Walla Valley was now his home.After a devastating freeze in 2004, Charles brought to life a label he had once in a dream: House Wine. Low and behold, the label concept had never been created or trademarked, so Charles launched the legendary brand before selling it to Precept Brands in 2006. That same year, Charles started a second brand, Charles Smith Wines. The brand was themed as “The Modernist Project, which focuses on the way people generally consume wine today: immediately. The intent was (and still is) to create wines to be enjoyed now, but with true typicity of both the varietal and the vineyard.A self-taught winemaker, Charles is a true artisan and a pioneer in the wine world. In 2008, K Vintners was recognized by Wine & Spirits magazine as one of the “Best New Wineries of the Last Ten Years, and as “Winery of the Year in their annual buying guide.

It was with the ""savoir-faire"" of a vigneron we created in 1997 a negociant activity that one could call a ""Negociant-Vigneron"". During my various travels and tastings in the Rhône Valley, I often thought that many great terroirs were under-exploited. I really liked some locations and I wanted to try. My wish was to become a negociant which would work with the spirit of a vigneron using ancient methods. This was meaning: being and remaining a small producer, be followed by winemakers having the same ambition, transport my wines in casks to avoid to rack them and kill their fruit, trying to do only nice things every day.At Saint Cosme we usually work ""à la main”. I want to make wines which express their terroir with purity and personality. I want to make balanced wines with a great ability to age.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Ramirez de la Piscina Rioja Crianza,Spain,Rioja,Rioja Alta,Tempranillo,Still wine,$15.99,$12.99,"Vineyards:At least 25 years old. Located in Abalos and San Vicente de la Sonsierra, Rioja Alta. Clay and Limestone soil.Vinification: Bunches are carefully sorted on the selection table, and then destemmed and transferred to a tank for skin-contact maceration. After several days, tumultuous fermentation starts in the liquid found underneath the cap of skins floating on the surface. Automatic pumping-over and punching-down allow the tannins and colour to be extracted from the grape skins. The entire fermentation is temperature-controlled in order to favour the survival of the yeasts until the end of the process. When fermentation finishes, the wine is run off by gravity.This method of destemming ensures a greater concentration of polyphenols and colour, which will be absolutely vital for the wine’s ageing in barrel.Ageing: After alcoholic and malolactic fermentation, the wine is racked into 225 litre American and French oak barrels where it spends 15 months ageing in our bodega’s underground cellars.Thereafter the wine is transferred back to the tanks for 5 months of natural fining and settling before filtering and bottling.Ageing is completed in the bottle.

 Coppola Directors Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$23.99,$17.97,"”I’ve always been influenced by the idea of Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, which was the inspiration for ultimately all modern amusements parks. I remember the beautiful theater pavilions with the curtains painted with peacock feathers that had little ballet performances. At Tivoli, there were rides, but more important than the rides were the cafes and the refreshments, and just the sense of being in a children’s garden, a ‘pleasure garden’ for all people to enjoy - which perhaps is the best phrase to describe what we’re creating here. This vision was replicated at places on Coney Island, like Luna Park, and George C. Tilyou’s Steeplechase Park, or Palisades Park. These were basically wonderlands, and I thought Francis Ford Coppola Winery could become such a park for the family to go and enjoy, where there are things for kids to do, so they can be close to their parents who are sampling wines and foods.I’ve often felt that modern life tends to separate all the ages too much. In the old days, the children lived with the parents and the grandparents, and the family unit each gave one another something very valuable. So when we began to develop the idea for this winery, we thought it should be like a resort, basically a wine wonderland, a park of pleasure where people of all ages can enjoy the best things in life - food, wine, music, dancing, games, swimming and performances of all types. A place to celebrate the love of life.”- Francis Ford CoppolaFor more than thirty years, we have been committed to environmentally responsible business practices. It’s been our goal to minimize our impact on the environment by seeking out innovative ways to produce and package our goods.At Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all 24 planted acres are sustainably farmed and part of the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program. We try to purchase fruit from growers who farm sustainably, and some of the vineyards we source from are certified organic as well. Another benefit of participating in the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program is that we have subsequently become a learning-teaching vineyard. Every technique we implement is thoroughly documented so that we, and neighboring Sonoma winegrowers, can pinpoint the best ways to protect our land and craft the best wines from these vineyards.We are also actively involved in the Fish Friendly Farming certification program. While this may seem like a matter totally unrelated to wine, watershed quality management is intrinsically connected to farming our vineyard because our property includes two blue-line creeks. These creeks are a part of the Russian River watershed that supports steelhead trout and Coho salmon populations. In conjunction with our neighbors and local, state, and federal agencies, we work diligently to promote the overall health of the Russian River watershed so that the entire ecosystem remains in balance and is preserved for generations to come.Our winegrowing practices involve the Integrated Pest Management program, which discusses the best practices for maintaining soil and vine health and proactively farming to reduce and treat pest pressures. Field experts provide monthly lectures concerning pest problems and solutions which we implement in our vineyard. Through our integrated pest management program, we have complemented the biodiversity of our vineyard by promoting the presence of beneficial insects, soil fauna, and owls that combat pests of grapevines.Finally, we recycle our grape and water waste by fertilizing with composted grape pomace and irrigating only with reclaimed winery wastewater.  In effect, we have closed the loop on our waste system in an effort to reduce our carbon footprint on the land we so love.Outside of the vineyard, our Francis Coppola Diamond Collection wines are packaged in 100% recycled cardboard case boxes, and all of the corks we purchase come from sustainable cork forests. Additionally, we insist that the label and foil companies we do business with have environmentally friendly practices as well.During the reconstruction of Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all of the crews, vendors, and sub-contractors we hired were local residents, helping to cut down on transportation costs, as well as supporting the economy of our community.Rather than use new lumber for the construction, we reused the wood from the Redwood trees that were removed from the courtyard area. Some of this timber was used to build the main reception desk in the Guest Services building, while other portions has been used to build the outdoor dining tables. The pyramid skylights in our towers feature an environmentally friendly material called Kalwall to construct skylights. This material diffuses light in such a way that little artificial lighting is needed, which helps conserve energy.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

There we were, sitting around a campfire, in what is now a vineyard that we’re sourcing 10 tons of Pinot Noir from this harvest, talking about the similarities between our cold and foggy Sonoma Coast and the various sub-appellations of the Willamette Valley.  From the cold wind that funnels from the Pacific Ocean through low-lying gaps in the coastal mountain ranges (the Van Duzer Corridor in Oregon and the Petaluma Wind Gap in Sonoma), to the mix of marine sedimentary and volcanic influenced soils that play off of one another to create the micro-terroirs of each appellation.  The similarities were shocking.  What got us really excited was that we saw the potential to make wine at the very highest level, using what were considered at the time to be the very top vineyard sites, all at a cost that was considerably less that what we were experiencing in the Sonoma Coast.  Oregon reminded us of where the Sonoma Coast was 10-15 years ago.  Still finding its way in terms of consistency, but when done right, way over-delivering.  The quality was there in a big way, but the prices were still so reasonable.As fate would have it, we reconnected with our friend and winemaker Adam Smith, who made the very first vintage of Banshee Wines in California for us.  Adam moved to Oregon in 2010 and has made wine at Shea Cellars, Domaine Serene, and has made all three vintages of the highly sought-after new project from Meo-Camuzet.

 Gazela Vinho Verde,Portugal,Minho,Vinho Verde,Non-Varietal White Blend,Still wine,,$7.99,"Gazela is a strategic brand for Sogrape Vinhos’ Vinho Verde offereing.  It also assumes a major role in the sector thanks to its dynamism and innovation, as reflected in its attractive image and proactive communication programme. Gazela appeared in 1984 and was introduced to the market as ”Gazela, a pedigree Vinho Verde”, seeking to reinforce values of freshness and lightness, especially the care taken in producing it and the heritage of its origins. In 1995, the brand image underwent its first change. The wine maintains the same quality as always, the bottle remains unchanged, but a new, more stylish label was introduced bearing a simple colour arrangement, dominated by green. The lettering became more legible and created more impact. Gazela’s rise has been gradual, but steady and sustained, based on product quality and assertive communication, relying on the brand values, with the aim of recruiting new and young consumers. Always focusing on innovation and the creation of strong brands, in 2004 Sogrape Vinhos decided to relaunch and reposition Gazela, aiming to modernise and streamline the Vinho Verde category and assume its leadership. Retaining the brand’s timeless values  - freshness, lightness, attractiveness and versatility - now re-styled into a contemporary and young brand, Gazela comes in new and original packaging. Young, stylish, modern and original, the strong aesthetic component of Gazela’s new presentation contains design elements that are hard to miss. This relaunch is backed by a new communication campaign, the largest wine promotion investment ever made in Portugal. The creative aspect was designed to stimulate tasting and renewing interest in the brand, reinforcing the emotional bond with consumers. With the claim ”Gazela - Goes well with life” the campaign clearly and succinctly expresses the brand values. Everything changes! Everything, but the Wine and the Brand. In recent years, there has been an ’explosion’ in consumer awareness and sales of Gazela, confirming that the wine’s quality and image have definitively made their mark on consumers, rewarding the effort and great development potential embodied by the brand. The ”Gazela goes well with life” concept is still going strong, further underlined by the way the brand is becoming an integral part of those every day great occasions that make us smile, believe and dream. The brand has a sustained growth momentum and it has assumed leadership of this market segment.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Domaine des Billards Saint-Amour,France,Burgundy,Beaujolais,Gamay,Still wine,$19.99,$17.99,"In 1821 the mayor of Chenas, Jean-Marie Loron, began exporting the wines Beaujolais and Macon around the world. After taking over the business some years later, Jean-Marie’s son married one of the daughters of the Charlet family in 1852. Her family owned the Clos de Billards vineyard in Saint Amour and, following the marriage, the two businesses merged. By the 1900’s the Loron family was one of the most famous negotiants in Beaujolais, with holdings in almost all of the famous crus. Unlike other negotiants, however, the individual domaines continued to produce their wine independently using the traditional methods they always had. Six generations later, this venerable family is still firmly rooted in the region and still producing outstanding Beaujolais. The wines are made by Xavier and Gregory Barbet, direct decedents of the original owners, and are labeled under the Barbet name.This is seriously old-school winemaking: after hand-harvesting, the grapes undergo semi-carbonic maceration in vats using only indigenous yeasts. The wines are then aged half in cement tanks and half in large old wooden foudres with a light fining before bottling. Although delicious when young, the wines are incredibly age-worthy. A recent tasting of wines ranging back into the mid-1970’s showed great intensity and complexity without any sign of fatigue.The Beaujolais region is finally getting the recognition it deserves and the Barbets are a perfect example of why; these are impressive wines with surprising complexity and elegance. They would not be out of place in any collector’s cellar nor on the table with your next meal. Luckily, good Beaujolais is still one of the great values in French wine.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"
 Carmel Vineyard Selected Moscato,Israel,N/A,N/A,Muscat Blanc A Petits Grains,Still wine,$11.79,$9.99,"Carmel Winery is the historic winery of Israel. It was founded in 1882 by Baron Edmond de Rothschild, owner of Chateau Lafite in Bordeaux. Carmel owns the two largest wineries in Israel, at Rishon Le Zion, south of Tel Aviv and at Zichron Ya’acov, south of Haifa. Each has deep underground cellars built by Rothschild in the 19th century.The story of Carmel represents the story of Israel, and the recent developments of Carmel’s wine, symbolizes the revolution of Israeli wine in recent years.Carmel Winery has 3,472 acres of vineyards, which cover the land of Israel from the Upper Galilee in the north, to the Negev in the south. Carmel’s winemakers can therefore choose from vineyards with different terroirs from all the wine regions in Israel. Carmel has a particularly strong vineyard presence in the cooler climate of the Upper Galilee, from where many of the leading wines are sourced.Carmel’s Rishon Le Zion Wine Cellars, built in 1890, is the oldest winery in Israel still in use. Two future Israeli prime ministers worked there and the first ever use of electricity and telephone in Israel was at the winery. Rishon Le Zion is now the fourth biggest city in Israel and it has literally grown around the winery, which sits in the center of a residential area. Carmel’s main blending & bottling facility is at Rishon Le Zion, which is also where the company’s head office is located.Carmel’s Zichron Ya’acov Wine Cellars, built in 1892, is the largest winery in Israel. On the premises is a modern, state-of-the-art facility making small quantities of quality wines from Carmel’s finest vineyards. The most advanced, modern winemaking technology blends in with the historic 120 year old cellars. The name of the winery is in memory of Edmond de Rothschild’s father, Baron James Jacob (Ya’acov) de Rothschild, who purchased the famous Bordeaux winery, Chateau Lafite, for the Rothschild family. Zichron Ya’acov is a charming town which still has an atmosphere of pre-state Israel. It is situated south of Haifa on the southern slopes of Mount Carmel, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.Lior Lacser is the Chief Winemaker of Carmel Winery.

At the tender age of fourteen he was accepted into the viticulture program at the prestigious Scuola Enologica de Conegliano (Conegliano Veneto School of Enology) in the heart of the province of Treviso where La Marca now sources the grapes for its Prosecco. Here, at Italy’s foremost wine school and viticulture research station, his true passion for the craft of the winemaker began to blossom. Fabrizio seized every opportunity to acquire the techniques of modern winemaking. He later worked and studied at both R. Phillips Winery and Martin Brothers Winery in California, where he had ample opportunity to apply the techniques he had learned.By combining his wide range of experience, Fabrizio has evolved into one of the most respected winemakers in Italy today.

 Dows Late Bottle Vintage,Portugal,Duriense,Douro - Porto,Port Blend,Still wine,,$24.99,"Whilst the majority of Port is now made with modern methods using state-of-the-art vinification technology, a small proportion is still produced by the time-honoured method of treading. In either system, fermentations are relatively short (two to three days) because Port is a fortified wine. Fortification, which involves the addition of natural grape spirit to the fermenting juice, intentionally interrupts the fermentation process at a point when approximately half of the grapes’ natural sugar has been converted into alcohol. This accounts for Port’s characteristic rich, luscious style and also contributes to the wine’s considerable ageing potential. Given the short fermentation cycle it is crucial to extract as much flavour, colour and tannins as possible from the grape skins.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"
 Produttori del Barbaresco,Italy,Piedmont,Barbaresco,Nebbiolo,Still wine,$44.99,$39.99,"Prior to 1894, Nebbiolo grapes were sold to make Barolo wine or simply labeled ”Nebbiolo di Barbaresco”. But in 1894, Domizio Cavazza, headmaster of the Royal Enological School of Alba and a Barbaresco resident, created the first cooperative, the ”Cantine Sociali”, by gathering together nine Barbaresco vineyard owners to make wine in the local castle that he owned. Cavazza understood that there were differences between Nebbiolo grapes grown in the Barolo district versus the same grapes grown in the Barbaresco district and, for the first time, recognized it on the wine label. The ”Cantine Sociali” was forced to close in the 1920’S because of fascist economic rules. In 1958, the priest of the village of Barbaresco, recognizing that the only way the small properties could survive was by joining their efforts, gathered together nineteen small growers and founded the Produttori del Barbaresco. The first three vintages were made in the church basement, and then in the winery built across the square from where the Produttori is still located. United once again, the small growers continued the work started by Domizio Cavazza, producing only Barbaresco wine and enhancing both the reputation of the wine and the village. The proud past of Barbaresco and the dedication of its creators have made the Produttori one of the greatest producers in a great wine-producing area; it... ”continues to set some of the highest standards of wine making for any cooperative in the world”. (Robert M. Parker, Jr.; The Wine Advocate, 2-28-90). The Produttori del Barbaresco, founded in 1958, now has 56 members and 100 hectares (250 acres) of Nebbiolo vineyards in the Barbaresco appellation, which amounts to almost 1/6 of the vineyards of the area.Each family is in full control of its land, growing Nebbiolo grapes with centuries old skill and dedication. The winery produces a Barbaresco D.O.C.G., a blend of Nebbiolo grapes harvested from different vineyards, and a simpler Nebbiolo Langhe suited for earlier consumption. In great vintages, nine single-vineyard Barbarescos are produced from nine classic premium sites within the Barbaresco village boundaries: Asili, Rabaja, Pora, Montestefano, Ovello, Paje, Montefico, Moccagatta and Rio Sordo. These are the geographical names of sites where Nebbiolo grapes have always been cultivated. The names of the single-vineyards, the total number of bottles produced, and the name of the owners of the vineyards are marked on the labels. The Produttori del Barbaresco, which vinifies only Nebbiolo grapes, produces around 420,000 bottles (35,000 cases) per year. In a good vintage they are divided among Barbaresco (40%), single vineyard Barbarescos (40%) and Nebbiolo Langhe (20%).

 Landmark Chardonnay Overlook,United States,California,N/A,Chardonnay,Still wine,$28.59,$19.99,"We believe wine is an essential part of gracious living and Landmark enhances the experience of every meal and social gathering.The success of Landmark Vineyards began in the heartland of America in 1838. It began when John Deere invented the steel plow and unearthed America’s agricultural abundance.That commitment to innovative means of production and respect for the land, and what the land had to offer, moved like a DNA chromosome from one generation to another until it found another challenge in the soil of California, Sonoma County, wine country: Landmark Vineyards.Landmark Vineyards was originally founded in Windsor, Sonoma County in 1974. It was a small family winery that was slowly being smothered by urban sprawl. But the facility was saved in 1989, when Damaris Deere Ethridge. the great, great, granddaughter of John Deere, visited wine country with a vision. Like her ancestor, she wanted to reunite herself and her family with the soil.Damaris believed Landmark could be a small jewel of a winery, producing limited amounts of the world’s finest Chardonnay. She purchased Landmark and relocated the facility from Windsor to Kenwood. She built a winery combining a traditional Spanish mission style exterior with a bright contemporary interior equipped with the state-of-the-art winemaking equipment. It was a blend of old and new, of what the land knew and the promise it offered. Having a clear vision for the future, her next step was to fill it with people who would execute her plans. She started by convincing her son, Michael Deere Colhoun and his wife Mary, to move from the east coast and join her as partners in the winery.Once settled, the Colhouns set in motion a plan that would truly make the winery a landmark. In 1993, they hired the world-renowned consulting enologist Helen Turly to work with Eric Stern, Landmark’s winemaker. Eric has the distinction of being the only winemaker in the world to have attended the Julliard School of Music; however, he had a calling to switch muses -from Orpheus to Bacchus. Like a skilled musician, Eric took the notes he had been given and created a great fugue, bringing together grapes from selected diverse vineyards, innovative and traditional techniques, and French oak to produce an opulent and elegant wine that made the name Landmark synonymous with ”super premium” Chardonnay.This winery remains one of the best kept secrets for outstanding Chardonnays as well as increasingly sumptuous Pinot Noirs.Rober M. Parker, Jr, The Wine Advocate, Issue 132As the Chardonnay has gained reputation and prominence in the marketplace, Pinot Noir became an additional focus and passion for the Landmark team. With the strong belief that vineyards and terroir make great wine, Landmark’s limited Pinot Noir is making a mark in the world of wine.Our story is about soil, innovation and dedication: a legacy that has been passed down through Deere generations for 162 years. We seek to make the best wine possible because we live in the best possible place on Earth. We want to share our bounty with the rest of the world; after all... that is the point of being a Landmark.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Quady Essencia Muscat,United States,California,N/A,Muscat Blanc A Petits Grains,Still wine,$28.19,$21.99,"First there were two – Andrew and Laurel Quady left crowded southern California and their jobs in pyrotechnics and merchandising to pursue their dream: a non-urban way of life making wine. Returning to school, Andrew graduated with a Masters in Food Science-Enology from UC Davis and Laurel became a licensed CPA. In 1975, at the urging of friend Darrell Corti, they made their first port from Amador County Zinfandel in Lodi. In 1977, settled in Madera in California’s San Joaquin Valley with Andrew working at a nearby winery, they built their own small winery behind their country home and made port on evenings and weekends. In 1980 they made a fortified dessert wine from the obscure Orange Muscat grape variety. The wine, Essensia, was unlike anything in the dessert wine field and became a major success. In 1983, opportunity knocked when they were offered a crop of Black Muscat grapes that became Elysium, the first dessert wine to smell of roses.Then there were four – By 1982 the expanding business needed space and Andrew and Laurel needed help. While still working on his winemaking degree at Fresno State, now winemaker Michael Blaylock moonlighted evenings during crush. Michael became Quady’s full time winemaker in 1984 and never looked back. Quady’s continued rise and recognition across the industry for extremely high quality is due to Michael’s exacting standards from the vineyard to the bottle. Cheryl Russell, Quady’s general manager also joined full time in 1984, and the dedicated team worked together to achieve consistent success. With their enthusiasm and integrity the winery continued to grow, developing more unique wines: Starboard (our euphemism for port), Electra (white and red) and Vya vermouth. For more about Quady’s winemaker, Michael Blaylock, and general manager, Cheryl Russell, click here.Now there are more – Many of the Quady Winery staff have been with the winery for over twenty years. Production Manager Danny Mejia started in 1985 and Cellar Master Mauro Molina in 1988.

Additionally, Syrah, Sangiovese, Nebbiolo and Orange Muscat add to the estate vineyard program. The steep hillside vineyards yield little water and thus, most of the acreage is dry farmed and all the grapes must be hand harvested. Soils are a very important ingredient to their wines` success. Painstaking care is exercised in matching the extremely varied soils to the varietals to coax the truest expression of each varietal`s character and complexity. The vineyards are continuously being updated. Currently, some areas are being replanted to expand Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc acreage using resistant rootstock and French clones to enhance the choice of Bordeaux varietals for their ISOSCELES program.

 Annabella Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$19.99,$13.99,"Michael’s wine roots trace back to the late 1800’s in Piedmont, Italy where his great grandfather first planted vines.  After traveling to America in the early-mid 1900’s, Michael’s grandfather moved to Sonoma where he planted 35 acres of Zinfandel in 1948. Some of these original vines still exist today and can be seen at the end of Pozzan Road in Healdsburg, Sonoma County.  Michael grew up spending his summers at his grandparent’s vineyard and it is the foundation from which his passions spawned.As a young adult, Michael became involved in the California wine industry working for several companies focused on imports and distribution.  It wasn’t until 1990 that Michael, with the loving support of his wife Mary Ann, left his sales position to follow his dream of producing his own wine.  Displaying a keen pallet and a knack for blending, Michael Pozzan released his first vintage in 1991, consisting of 200 cases.  Over the years his success grew as he formed stronger relationships with winemaking peers and growers, giving him the edge in producing fine wines from the most competitive region in the country. Now celebrating over 25 years of production, Michael is joined by his two sons, Dante and Matthew Pozzan, as the family winery looks to continue their passion of producing fine wines with balance and personality.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"
 Coppola Diamond Pinot Grigo,United States,California,N/A,Pinot Gris,Still wine,$16.69,$12.99,"”I’ve always been influenced by the idea of Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, which was the inspiration for ultimately all modern amusements parks. I remember the beautiful theater pavilions with the curtains painted with peacock feathers that had little ballet performances. At Tivoli, there were rides, but more important than the rides were the cafes and the refreshments, and just the sense of being in a children’s garden, a ‘pleasure garden’ for all people to enjoy - which perhaps is the best phrase to describe what we’re creating here. This vision was replicated at places on Coney Island, like Luna Park, and George C. Tilyou’s Steeplechase Park, or Palisades Park. These were basically wonderlands, and I thought Francis Ford Coppola Winery could become such a park for the family to go and enjoy, where there are things for kids to do, so they can be close to their parents who are sampling wines and foods.I’ve often felt that modern life tends to separate all the ages too much. In the old days, the children lived with the parents and the grandparents, and the family unit each gave one another something very valuable. So when we began to develop the idea for this winery, we thought it should be like a resort, basically a wine wonderland, a park of pleasure where people of all ages can enjoy the best things in life - food, wine, music, dancing, games, swimming and performances of all types. A place to celebrate the love of life.”- Francis Ford CoppolaFor more than thirty years, we have been committed to environmentally responsible business practices. It’s been our goal to minimize our impact on the environment by seeking out innovative ways to produce and package our goods.At Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all 24 planted acres are sustainably farmed and part of the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program. We try to purchase fruit from growers who farm sustainably, and some of the vineyards we source from are certified organic as well. Another benefit of participating in the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program is that we have subsequently become a learning-teaching vineyard. Every technique we implement is thoroughly documented so that we, and neighboring Sonoma winegrowers, can pinpoint the best ways to protect our land and craft the best wines from these vineyards.We are also actively involved in the Fish Friendly Farming certification program. While this may seem like a matter totally unrelated to wine, watershed quality management is intrinsically connected to farming our vineyard because our property includes two blue-line creeks. These creeks are a part of the Russian River watershed that supports steelhead trout and Coho salmon populations. In conjunction with our neighbors and local, state, and federal agencies, we work diligently to promote the overall health of the Russian River watershed so that the entire ecosystem remains in balance and is preserved for generations to come.Our winegrowing practices involve the Integrated Pest Management program, which discusses the best practices for maintaining soil and vine health and proactively farming to reduce and treat pest pressures. Field experts provide monthly lectures concerning pest problems and solutions which we implement in our vineyard. Through our integrated pest management program, we have complemented the biodiversity of our vineyard by promoting the presence of beneficial insects, soil fauna, and owls that combat pests of grapevines.Finally, we recycle our grape and water waste by fertilizing with composted grape pomace and irrigating only with reclaimed winery wastewater.  In effect, we have closed the loop on our waste system in an effort to reduce our carbon footprint on the land we so love.Outside of the vineyard, our Francis Coppola Diamond Collection wines are packaged in 100% recycled cardboard case boxes, and all of the corks we purchase come from sustainable cork forests. Additionally, we insist that the label and foil companies we do business with have environmentally friendly practices as well.During the reconstruction of Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all of the crews, vendors, and sub-contractors we hired were local residents, helping to cut down on transportation costs, as well as supporting the economy of our community.Rather than use new lumber for the construction, we reused the wood from the Redwood trees that were removed from the courtyard area. Some of this timber was used to build the main reception desk in the Guest Services building, while other portions has been used to build the outdoor dining tables. The pyramid skylights in our towers feature an environmentally friendly material called Kalwall to construct skylights. This material diffuses light in such a way that little artificial lighting is needed, which helps conserve energy.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Sutter Home  Pinot Grigio,United States,California,N/A,Pinot Gris,Still wine,,$6.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the world’s leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Mario’s son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Home’s original philosophy to offer ”a great product for a fair price,” even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Produttori del Barb Nebbiolo Langhe,Italy,Piedmont,Langhe,Nebbiolo,Still wine,$27.59,$21.99,"Prior to 1894, Nebbiolo grapes were sold to make Barolo wine or simply labeled ”Nebbiolo di Barbaresco”. But in 1894, Domizio Cavazza, headmaster of the Royal Enological School of Alba and a Barbaresco resident, created the first cooperative, the ”Cantine Sociali”, by gathering together nine Barbaresco vineyard owners to make wine in the local castle that he owned. Cavazza understood that there were differences between Nebbiolo grapes grown in the Barolo district versus the same grapes grown in the Barbaresco district and, for the first time, recognized it on the wine label. The ”Cantine Sociali” was forced to close in the 1920’S because of fascist economic rules. In 1958, the priest of the village of Barbaresco, recognizing that the only way the small properties could survive was by joining their efforts, gathered together nineteen small growers and founded the Produttori del Barbaresco. The first three vintages were made in the church basement, and then in the winery built across the square from where the Produttori is still located. United once again, the small growers continued the work started by Domizio Cavazza, producing only Barbaresco wine and enhancing both the reputation of the wine and the village. The proud past of Barbaresco and the dedication of its creators have made the Produttori one of the greatest producers in a great wine-producing area; it... ”continues to set some of the highest standards of wine making for any cooperative in the world”. (Robert M. Parker, Jr.; The Wine Advocate, 2-28-90). The Produttori del Barbaresco, founded in 1958, now has 56 members and 100 hectares (250 acres) of Nebbiolo vineyards in the Barbaresco appellation, which amounts to almost 1/6 of the vineyards of the area.Each family is in full control of its land, growing Nebbiolo grapes with centuries old skill and dedication. The winery produces a Barbaresco D.O.C.G., a blend of Nebbiolo grapes harvested from different vineyards, and a simpler Nebbiolo Langhe suited for earlier consumption. In great vintages, nine single-vineyard Barbarescos are produced from nine classic premium sites within the Barbaresco village boundaries: Asili, Rabaja, Pora, Montestefano, Ovello, Paje, Montefico, Moccagatta and Rio Sordo. These are the geographical names of sites where Nebbiolo grapes have always been cultivated. The names of the single-vineyards, the total number of bottles produced, and the name of the owners of the vineyards are marked on the labels. The Produttori del Barbaresco, which vinifies only Nebbiolo grapes, produces around 420,000 bottles (35,000 cases) per year. In a good vintage they are divided among Barbaresco (40%), single vineyard Barbarescos (40%) and Nebbiolo Langhe (20%).

 Quady Elysium,United States,California,N/A,Black Muscat,Still wine,,$24.99,"First there were two – Andrew and Laurel Quady left crowded southern California and their jobs in pyrotechnics and merchandising to pursue their dream: a non-urban way of life making wine. Returning to school, Andrew graduated with a Masters in Food Science-Enology from UC Davis and Laurel became a licensed CPA. In 1975, at the urging of friend Darrell Corti, they made their first port from Amador County Zinfandel in Lodi. In 1977, settled in Madera in California’s San Joaquin Valley with Andrew working at a nearby winery, they built their own small winery behind their country home and made port on evenings and weekends. In 1980 they made a fortified dessert wine from the obscure Orange Muscat grape variety. The wine, Essensia, was unlike anything in the dessert wine field and became a major success. In 1983, opportunity knocked when they were offered a crop of Black Muscat grapes that became Elysium, the first dessert wine to smell of roses.Then there were four – By 1982 the expanding business needed space and Andrew and Laurel needed help. While still working on his winemaking degree at Fresno State, now winemaker Michael Blaylock moonlighted evenings during crush. Michael became Quady’s full time winemaker in 1984 and never looked back. Quady’s continued rise and recognition across the industry for extremely high quality is due to Michael’s exacting standards from the vineyard to the bottle. Cheryl Russell, Quady’s general manager also joined full time in 1984, and the dedicated team worked together to achieve consistent success. With their enthusiasm and integrity the winery continued to grow, developing more unique wines: Starboard (our euphemism for port), Electra (white and red) and Vya vermouth. For more about Quady’s winemaker, Michael Blaylock, and general manager, Cheryl Russell, click here.Now there are more – Many of the Quady Winery staff have been with the winery for over twenty years. Production Manager Danny Mejia started in 1985 and Cellar Master Mauro Molina in 1988. Since then, the staff has grown to include assistant winemaker Darin Peterson, six full time cellar employees, five office staff, and several part-time employees. The Quady Winery crew consistently surpasses expectations and takes great pride in working for an uncommon company",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

After achieving great success as a grower, Joe opened his own winery in 1979 with his business partner Lloyd Canton.Our first winemaker, Tom Mackey, joined St. Francis in 1983 and was renowned for elevating both the quality and style of Sonoma Merlot as an ultra-premium, stand-alone varietal.

That legacy began in 1933 upon the repeal of prohibition when Rudy Kopf founded the wine and spirits department of Macy’s Department Store in New York, turning it into what was then one of the finest wine and spirits retailers in the country.

 Sterling Vineyard Chardonnay Napa,United States,California,Napa County,Chardonnay,Still wine,$25.59,$19.99,"The depth and complexity of our Napa Valley Chardonnay comes from the broad range of vineyards that span the length of the valley, from the cooler microclimates of Carneros and Oak Knoll up through the warmer regions of Yountville and Rutherford.

In particular, the wine reflects the richness of the up-valley grapes, which give a stamp of classic golden fruit that sets this wine apart.“Chardonnay is a giving varietal,” explains Winemaker John Hazak. “As winemakers, we can play with it, coax forward its style and add layers and volume during winemaking.” A majority of this wine went through small-lot barrel fermentation, followed by sur lie aging with batonnage every three weeks. The distinctly ripe style and racy acidity of our Rutherford grapes developed dimensions and mouthfeel with complete malolactic fermentation, while the heady French oak married well with the supple nature of the fruit, giving a voluptuous softness to the wine.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

Fortification, which involves the addition of natural grape spirit to the fermenting juice, intentionally interrupts the fermentation process at a point when approximately half of the grapes’ natural sugar has been converted into alcohol. This accounts for Port’s characteristic rich, luscious style and also contributes to the wine’s considerable ageing potential.

Carmel has a particularly strong vineyard presence in the cooler climate of the Upper Galilee, from where many of the leading wines are sourced.Carmel’s Rishon Le Zion Wine Cellars, built in 1890, is the oldest winery in Israel still in use. Two future Israeli prime ministers worked there and the first ever use of electricity and telephone in Israel was at the winery. Rishon Le Zion is now the fourth biggest city in Israel and it has literally grown around the winery, which sits in the center of a residential area. Carmel’s main blending & bottling facility is at Rishon Le Zion, which is also where the company’s head office is located.Carmel’s Zichron Ya’acov Wine Cellars, built in 1892, is the largest winery in Israel. On the premises is a modern, state-of-the-art facility making small quantities of quality wines from Carmel’s finest vineyards. The most advanced, modern winemaking technology blends in with the historic 120 year old cellars. The name of the winery is in memory of Edmond de Rothschild’s father, Baron James Jacob (Ya’acov) de Rothschild, who purchased the famous Bordeaux winery, Chateau Lafite, for the Rothschild family. Zichron Ya’acov is a charming town which still has an atmosphere of pre-state Israel. It is situated south of Haifa on the southern slopes of Mount Carmel, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.Lior Lacser is the Chief Winemaker of Carmel Winery. He is a graduate of CFPPA in Beaune in Burgundy. He has experience in both Burgundy and Bordeaux having worked at Domaine Comte Armand, Pommard and at Chateau le Bon Pasteur, Pomerol. He worked with Michel Rolland, one of the most influential winemakers in the world today. He followed this with work experience in Australia, working for Harman’s Ridge Estate in the Margaret River region of West Australia. He joined Carmel in 2003 and was appointed the Chief Winemaker of Carmel Winery in 2005.Lacser heads a department of eight winemakers, and works closely with a team of expert viticulturists.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Coppola Diamond Pinot Noir Blue Label,United States,California,Monterey County,Pinot Noir,Still wine,$18.99,$15.97,"”I’ve always been influenced by the idea of Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, which was the inspiration for ultimately all modern amusements parks. I remember the beautiful theater pavilions with the curtains painted with peacock feathers that had little ballet performances. At Tivoli, there were rides, but more important than the rides were the cafes and the refreshments, and just the sense of being in a children’s garden, a ‘pleasure garden’ for all people to enjoy - which perhaps is the best phrase to describe what we’re creating here. This vision was replicated at places on Coney Island, like Luna Park, and George C. Tilyou’s Steeplechase Park, or Palisades Park. These were basically wonderlands, and I thought Francis Ford Coppola Winery could become such a park for the family to go and enjoy, where there are things for kids to do, so they can be close to their parents who are sampling wines and foods.I’ve often felt that modern life tends to separate all the ages too much. In the old days, the children lived with the parents and the grandparents, and the family unit each gave one another something very valuable. So when we began to develop the idea for this winery, we thought it should be like a resort, basically a wine wonderland, a park of pleasure where people of all ages can enjoy the best things in life - food, wine, music, dancing, games, swimming and performances of all types. A place to celebrate the love of life.”- Francis Ford CoppolaFor more than thirty years, we have been committed to environmentally responsible business practices. It’s been our goal to minimize our impact on the environment by seeking out innovative ways to produce and package our goods.At Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all 24 planted acres are sustainably farmed and part of the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program. We try to purchase fruit from growers who farm sustainably, and some of the vineyards we source from are certified organic as well. Another benefit of participating in the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program is that we have subsequently become a learning-teaching vineyard. Every technique we implement is thoroughly documented so that we, and neighboring Sonoma winegrowers, can pinpoint the best ways to protect our land and craft the best wines from these vineyards.We are also actively involved in the Fish Friendly Farming certification program. While this may seem like a matter totally unrelated to wine, watershed quality management is intrinsically connected to farming our vineyard because our property includes two blue-line creeks. These creeks are a part of the Russian River watershed that supports steelhead trout and Coho salmon populations. In conjunction with our neighbors and local, state, and federal agencies, we work diligently to promote the overall health of the Russian River watershed so that the entire ecosystem remains in balance and is preserved for generations to come.Our winegrowing practices involve the Integrated Pest Management program, which discusses the best practices for maintaining soil and vine health and proactively farming to reduce and treat pest pressures. Field experts provide monthly lectures concerning pest problems and solutions which we implement in our vineyard. Through our integrated pest management program, we have complemented the biodiversity of our vineyard by promoting the presence of beneficial insects, soil fauna, and owls that combat pests of grapevines.Finally, we recycle our grape and water waste by fertilizing with composted grape pomace and irrigating only with reclaimed winery wastewater.  In effect, we have closed the loop on our waste system in an effort to reduce our carbon footprint on the land we so love.Outside of the vineyard, our Francis Coppola Diamond Collection wines are packaged in 100% recycled cardboard case boxes, and all of the corks we purchase come from sustainable cork forests. Additionally, we insist that the label and foil companies we do business with have environmentally friendly practices as well.During the reconstruction of Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all of the crews, vendors, and sub-contractors we hired were local residents, helping to cut down on transportation costs, as well as supporting the economy of our community.Rather than use new lumber for the construction, we reused the wood from the Redwood trees that were removed from the courtyard area. Some of this timber was used to build the main reception desk in the Guest Services building, while other portions has been used to build the outdoor dining tables. The pyramid skylights in our towers feature an environmentally friendly material called Kalwall to construct skylights. This material diffuses light in such a way that little artificial lighting is needed, which helps conserve energy.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"
 Markham Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$45.19,$33.99,"Bordeaux immigrant Jean Laurent came to California in 1852 to seek gold but instead founded one of the first wineries in Napa Valley. Laurent built his Napa winery in 1874, which started as a modest wooden structure. Business was good and in 1879 he built a stone cellar that is the heart of our present-day winery. Laurent was one of the largest producers of the California wine boom in the 1880s. In those days, wines were sold in bulk and shipped by train to the east coast. After Laurent’s death in 1890, the winery continued operating under a succession of owners.Bruce Markham arrived in the Napa Valley almost 100 years later, and like Laurent, he was looking to start a winery. He purchased vineyards in Yountville, Oak Knoll, and Calistoga and later the old Laurent winery, which was operating under the United Vintners (Heublein) at the time. In 1978, he founded Markham Vineyards and the old Laurent winery was reborn. In its early days Markham focused on Cabernet Sauvignon and introduced the first Markham Merlot with the 1980 vintage. From 1978 to 1988 the winery’s production increased from 3,500 cases to 20,000 cases. The wine quality and praise from wine critics and consumers increased as well.In 1988, the old Laurent Winery once again opened a new chapter of its long distinguished life. The winery was sold to Mercian Corporation and began an ambitious renovation, expansion and vineyard-replanting program. These efforts would more than double the capacity and make Markham one of the most advanced, stunning winemaking facilities in the country. Even through the dust of the renovation, Markham was able to produce three of the number-one rated wines from California, as judged by Wine Spectator magazine.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Far Niente Chardonnay Estate,United States,California,Napa County,Chardonnay,Still wine,$76.59,$59.99,"Far Niente Winery was established in 1885 by John Benson, a forty-niner of the California gold rush and uncle of the famous American impressionist painter, Winslow Homer. Benson hired architect Hamden McIntyre, creator of the former Christian Brothers winery-now the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone-to design the building. Constructed against a hillside in western Oakville, Far Niente functioned as a gravity flow winery, gently moving the grapes through each stage of production.Far Niente prospered until the onset of Prohibition in 1919, when it was abandoned and left to fall into disrepair. Sixty years later, in 1979, Gil Nickel purchased the winery and adjacent vineyard and began a three-year restoration of the property, which resulted in placement on the National Register of Historical Places. During restoration, the original name, Far Niente, from an Italian phrase that romantically translated means “without a care,” was found carved in stone on the front of the building where it remains to this day. We felt an obligation to preserve the name with the hope that we could recapture a bygone era when life was indeed without a care.Nineteen eighty-two marked the return of winemaking to Far Niente, with the harvest of the winery’s first Cabernet Sauvignon. Chardonnay was also produced at the winery for the first time that year; the 1979, ’80 and ’81 vintage wines were made at an offsite location. Today, the winery continues to focus on producing only the two varietal wines.California’s Oldest Bottle of WineFar Niente’s past and present were reunited in 1998, when a bottle of Far Niente Sweet Muscat, vintage 1886, was discovered in a private cellar in Marin County, California. The bottle exhibits the original label, cork and capsule, and is believed to be the oldest intact bottle of California wine in existence today.The label, featuring a sepia-tone line drawing of a hammock laden with grape clusters, is believed to have been designed by Benson’s nephew, artist Winslow Homer. Historians of the artist liken the style of the hammock on the label to the same technique employed in Homer’s other works. Eric Rudd, a historian and expert on Homer, has explained that while Homer created very little commercial art, he was known to have supplied his work to friends and relations for commercial use, including his cousin, Virginia Johnson. This was the same Virginia Johnson who inherited Far Niente in the early 1900s, from her uncle, John Benson.Today, Far Niente wines carry an intricate art nouveau-style parchment label, which was designed by artist Tom Rodrigues in 1979. Rodrigues also designed the labels for Far Niente’s sister wineries Dolce, Nickel & Nickel and EnRoute, producer of Pinot Noir in the Russian River Valley.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"
 Lindemans Cabernet Sauvignon Bin 45,Australia,South Eastern Australia,N/A,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,,$5.99,"Lindeman’s wines contain the spirit and passion of its founder, Dr. Henry J. Lindeman, whose philosophy was to craft wines for everyday enjoyment.In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property ‘Cawarra’ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindeman’s Wine Company became a public listed company.By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindeman’s Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindeman’s wines around the world.Lindeman’s Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindeman’s style of wines in the northern hemisphere. Following its success in Canada and the United States, Lindeman’s Bin 65 was ‘brought home’ to Australia in 1991.The winemaking team of nine is spread across Victoria and South Australia.

 Baron Herzog Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,N/A,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,,$10.99,"The Jewish people have a special relationship to wine that predates even the Romans and Greeks. For the ancient Jews, whose temple in Jerusalem was renowned throughout the fledgling civilizations of the Middle East, wine played an important role in religious ritual. Today, thousands of years later, it continues to do so. Kiddush, the prayer over the wine, traditionally announces the beginning of the Sabbath on Friday night as well as other holidays.And so it should come as no surprise that the Herzog family has been making wine for a long time. They trace their winemaking origins back to Philip Herzog, who made wine in Slovakia for the Austro-Hungarian court more than a century ago. Philip’s wines were so appreciated by Emperor Franz-Josef, that the emperor made Philip a baron. The Baron Herzog wines-a line of premium yet moderately priced California varietals-are named to commemorate the honor.Baron Philip made both kosher and non-kosher wines. The kosher wines were made in a separate cellar and tasted remarkably like his non-kosher wines. Indeed, the wines were made in the same basic manner. However, the kosher wines required a Jewish, Sabbath-observant cellar crew.During World War II, Philip’s grandson Eugene hid his family from the Nazis by moving them around the Slovakian countryside. After the war’s end, he emerged from behind a false wall in a courageous Christian friend’s woodshed to reclaim his family’s winery.But three years later, the new Czech communist regime drove the Herzogs away from their European home for good. Forced to leave with little more than the clothes on their backs, the family said goodbye to their former royal economic and social stature.Eugene brought the family to America in 1948 after the Holocaust.  He arrived in New York City with his wife, Sidonia, six of his own children and two additional war orphans. They moved to the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn with only enough money to rent a two-bedroom tenement flat. With his winemaking skills, Eugene found a job at a small kosher winery tucked away into a storefront on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. For a paltry salary, he made sweet, Concord-grape wines in the cellar. (European grape varieties for dry wines were not easy to obtain in post World War II New York.) He also drove the wine delivery truck. But because the company was so poor, he was paid for his driving acumen in company shares, not cash.For years the shares were worthless, but by 1958, all the other shareholders had given up their shares. They assumed the business was doomed to failure. Eugene and his sons, who all went to work at the winery, proved them wrong. They called their new venture Royal Wines, in deference to their grandfather, Philip.In 1985, the Herzog family decided to expand their winemaking operations to California, where they make wine under two separate labels: Baron Herzog and Herzog Wine Cellars. After twenty years of renting space in various wineries, the family was finally able to build its own state-of-the-art winery just south of Santa Barbara, in the town of Oxnard. Here, under the supervision of head winemaker Joe Hurliman, Herzog Wine Cellars has created a center for high-end contemporary winemaking in a tradition that dates back nearly six centuries.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

A truly hand crafted wine, we nurture our vines and attend to every detail to preserve the potential of the grapes. We hand harvest the fruit very early in the morning in small 14 kilos cases. The grapes were 100% hand de-stemmed in our Clos Apalta Winery so we maintain complete control of the quality. We fill our French oak tanks by gravity. Then nature does its work, allowing native yeasts that slowly ferment the must into wine with temperature control less than 26° C. Macerations lasted for about 4-5 weeks and during all that period we did manual punch downs to extract enough compounds from skins and seeds to get the desired structure and concentration. We rack the young new wine straight into 100% new French oak barrels by gravity. Malolactic fermentation happens in barrels, where the wine stays for 22 months, ageing patiently. The wine is bottled by gravity without any treatment or filtration.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Joel Gott Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$19.69,$14.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the world’s leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Mario’s son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Home’s original philosophy to offer ”a great product for a fair price,” even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Folie A Deux Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,,$19.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the world’s leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Mario’s son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Home’s original philosophy to offer ”a great product for a fair price,” even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

It was founded in 1882 by Baron Edmond de Rothschild, owner of Chateau Lafite in Bordeaux. Carmel owns the two largest wineries in Israel, at Rishon Le Zion, south of Tel Aviv and at Zichron Ya’acov, south of Haifa. Each has deep underground cellars built by Rothschild in the 19th century.The story of Carmel represents the story of Israel, and the recent developments of Carmel’s wine, symbolizes the revolution of Israeli wine in recent years.Carmel Winery has 3,472 acres of vineyards, which cover the land of Israel from the Upper Galilee in the north, to the Negev in the south. Carmel’s winemakers can therefore choose from vineyards with different terroirs from all the wine regions in Israel. Carmel has a particularly strong vineyard presence in the cooler climate of the Upper Galilee, from where many of the leading wines are sourced.Carmel’s Rishon Le Zion Wine Cellars, built in 1890, is the oldest winery in Israel still in use. Two future Israeli prime ministers worked there and the first ever use of electricity and telephone in Israel was at the winery. Rishon Le Zion is now the fourth biggest city in Israel and it has literally grown around the winery, which sits in the center of a residential area. Carmel’s main blending & bottling facility is at Rishon Le Zion, which is also where the company’s head office is located.Carmel’s Zichron Ya’acov Wine Cellars, built in 1892, is the largest winery in Israel. On the premises is a modern, state-of-the-art facility making small quantities of quality wines from Carmel’s finest vineyards. The most advanced, modern winemaking technology blends in with the historic 120 year old cellars. The name of the winery is in memory of Edmond de Rothschild’s father, Baron James Jacob (Ya’acov) de Rothschild, who purchased the famous Bordeaux winery, Chateau Lafite, for the Rothschild family. Zichron Ya’acov is a charming town which still has an atmosphere of pre-state Israel. It is situated south of Haifa on the southern slopes of Mount Carmel, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.Lior Lacser is the Chief Winemaker of Carmel Winery. He is a graduate of CFPPA in Beaune in Burgundy. He has experience in both Burgundy and Bordeaux having worked at Domaine Comte Armand, Pommard and at Chateau le Bon Pasteur, Pomerol.

 Dry Creek Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$26.99,$20.99,"The history of Dry Creek Vineyard is a long and colorful one. Founded in 1972 by David S. Stare, Dry Creek Vineyard paved the way for a renaissance of winemaking and viticulture in the Dry Creek Valley. Before his arrival, the Dry Creek Valley was little more than a few family farms and prune orchards. It was Dave’s vision to start a Loire Valley inspired winery, which triggered a viticultural reawakening in northern Sonoma County.Without a doubt, David Stare is a pioneer. Heading west in the late 1960s, he personified the character and work ethic of early Gold Rush pioneers. Educated at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Dave worked for the B&O Railroad for several years but quickly realized that his true calling was in the wine industry. Inspired by his trips to the Loire Valley, he headed west to California to start his own family winery.Upon his arrival, Dave began taking winemaking classes at UC Davis as a graduate student. On the weekends, he spent time looking at vineyard land from Monterey to Mendocino. It was during one of those weekend trips that fate drew Dave to the Dry Creek Valley. When he saw an old prune orchard across the street from the Dry Creek General Store, Dave realized that he had found his dream location. He purchased the orchard and began planting vines. Captivated by his memories of Loire-style wines, Sauvignon Blanc seemed destined to figure prominently in the Dry Creek Vineyard portfolio. However, several famed vineyard specialists advised him against planting Sauvignon Blanc. Always looking to push the envelope, Dave planted the varietal anyway and the rest is history.Today, our second-generation family owned winery continues to evolve and grow to meet the demands of a global wine marketplace. The primary mission of our winery is to produce distinctive wines that overdeliver on quality. For more than 40 years, this pursuit of winemaking excellence has led to many international awards and accolades. With a loyal following of wine club members and customers, the future of Dry Creek Vineyard has never been brighter.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Frei Brothers Sauvignon Blanc,United States,California,Sonoma County,Sauvignon Blanc,Still wine,$20.99,$15.99,"Frei Brothers Reserve is a winemaking story more than a century in the making. In 1890, Swiss immigrant Andrew Frei purchased the core of what is now Frei Ranch in Sonoma County’s Dry Creek Valley. The superb stretch of land was already a vineyard, but Frei brought it to prominence when he built a winery that produced 20,000 cases of wine annually by 1895. In 1903, Frei turned the winery over to his sons, Walter and Louis, who adopted the name Frei Brothers.After the repeal of Prohibition, the vineyards caught the eye of Julio Gallo, winemaker for the rapidly expanding E. & J. Gallo Winery. The Gallo family began buying grapes from Frei Ranch, eventually signing an agreement to purchase the estate’s annual wine grape crop.When Andrew Frei’s descendents retired in the late 1970s, the Gallo family purchased Frei Ranch, further developing the vineyard and the winery. Today, Frei Brothers Reserve carries on the rich legacy of both our home vineyard and Sonoma’s celebrated appellations.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

The juice is fermented on skins for up to 3 weeks allowing soft tannins to be formed into the rich and soft palate seen in many great Australian Shiraz`.The fermented wine is then drained and the skins pressed into a new vessel to allow a natural malolactic fermentation occur, giving a further softening and palate rounding to this rich variety.After settling, a portion of the volume is transferred to oak and allowed to mature for 6 months before blending back into the original wine, adding complexity and texture to the fruit driven palate.This wine is then chilled, clarified and bottled on the Estate to ensure maximum quality control in the final product.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Yellow Tail Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot,Australia,South Eastern Australia,N/A,"Cabernet Sauvignon,Merlot",Still wine,$17.29,$12.99,"”People can’t be bothered by all the hype and nonsense of wine. They just want to drink it.” ~John Casella.It all started in 1820, when the first Casellas planted some vines in the Italian countryside. Two things sprouted shortly thereafter: a cluster of grapes, and a family passion that would last 188 years and counting.Fast forward to 1957. Filippo and Maria Casella were keeping the business alive in Italy, when they decided to pack up and move to Australia. However far away, they couldn’t escape their wine roots. Filippo began selling grapes to local wineries. Then in 1969, he decided it was time for a new generation of Casellas to put their winemaking skills to use.Following the blueprint of other Australian winemakers, Casella sourced his fruit from other growing areas throughout South Eastern Australia, creating wines with incredible freshness and character year after year. Still, almost a third of the grapes used for [yellow tail] are grown right in the Casella family’s vineyards, nearly 540 acres in the Riverina region of Australia. In 1994, the Casellas built a new and improved winery, blending old world heritage with new world technology.From humble beginnings, this family has come a long way. Today the company is run by Filippo’s three sons—John, Joe and Marcello—while Filippo’s grandchildren have become the sixth generation to join the family business. In 2000, John Casella joined forces with another family-run company, W.J. Deutsch & Sons, to bring the goodness of [yellow tail] to the United States.Year after year, the Casella family continues to create quality wine that’s fun, flavorful, and bursting with a personality all of its own.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Calera Pinot Noir,United States,California,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Still wine,,$28.99,"Calera was officially founded in 1975, when owner/winemaker Josh Jensen planted his first 24 acres of pinot noir in three separate parcels in Mt. Harlan. Having studied in Burgundy, Josh was determined to follow in his mentors’ foot steps. He spent two years searching for limestone throughout California before finally purchasing a high-elevation parcel with a limestone subsoil in early 1974. (Limestone had even been commercially quarried here a 100 years earlier. To this day, there stands a magnificently well-preserved, 30-foot tall masonry limekiln, or ”calera” in Spanish. It thus serves as the winery’s symbol and appears on every bottle of wine.)Located 90 miles south of San Francisco and about 25 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean, Calera is near Mt. Harlan in San Benito County. Its elevation is 2,200 feet above sea level, making it one of the highest and coolest vineyard properties in California. All the vineyards are based on selected cuttings from Burgundy (“Calera Selection”), with new vineyards started from massale selections taken from older plots.In the Burgundian tradition, Josh named each parcel individually to emphasize the fact that each would produce a distinct wine. The original plantings are the Selleck Vineyard (5 acres), Reed Vineyard (5 acres), and Jensen Vineyard (14 acres). These vineyards produced their initial tiny crop in 1978.Josh made Calera’s first wine in 1975: 1000 cases of zinfandel produced from purchased grapes. During his first two years as a winemaker, he made the Calera wines in a rented space in a larger nearby winery. He gradually purchased more vineyard land, as well as property upon which he built his winery. Over the span of 25 years he transformed a multi-level rock crushing facility into a gravity-flow winery where the wines are moved by the mere force of gravity, rather than by the use of pumps. This multi-layered hillside construction has allowed for the gentlest possible handling of the Calera wines.In 1990 the U.S. government approved the Mt. Harlan AVA (American Viticultural Area), which is high in the Gavilan Mountains (the lowest point is at 1,800 feet above sea level). While it is a large AVA which comprises 7,400 acres, Calera’s are the only vineyards in the Mt. Harlan Viticultural Area.Calera’s winemaking is steeped in non-interventionist practices, such as the use of native yeasts, hand-harvesting, whole cluster fermentations, minimal racking, and fining and/or filtration only when necessary, insuring the bottled wines express all of the natural greatness of their vineyard origins.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Joel Gott Zinfandel,United States,California,N/A,Zinfandel,Still wine,$19.69,$14.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the world’s leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Mario’s son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Home’s original philosophy to offer ”a great product for a fair price,” even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Ghost Pines Zinfandel,United States,California,N/A,Zinfandel,Still wine,$19.69,$14.99,"PHILOSOPHYAt the heart of every glass of Ghost Pines is the notion that world-class wines are made from quality grapes – grapes that span many appellations. An unconventional view against today’s backdrop of single-appellation wines, the Ghost Pines philosophy is a modern take on visionary winemaker Louis M. Martini’s approach to winemaking. In the 1930s, Martini didn’t think about appellation boundaries. He simply sought the best grapes from the best vineyards to craft his unforgettable wines, long before American Viticulture Areas (AVAs) were established in California.Seventy-five years later, Napa’s historic Louis M. Martini Winery launched Ghost Pines to give Michael Eddy and a talented group of forward-thinking winemakers the freedom to blend the finest grapes across appellations. The result is a collection of sophisticated wines that illustrate the best characteristics of each varietal and region, balancing elegance with structure, intensity with nuance.Echoing the unharnessed, free-form character of its namesake tree, Ghost Pines embodies the progressive spirit of California winemaking: no boundaries, no limits. APPELLATIONSThe wines of Ghost Pines draw a veritable map of some of California’s most renowned wine appellations. Vintner Michael Eddy and his team of progressive winemakers search for the best grapes in Napa, Sonoma, Monterey and San Joaquin counties to make a remarkable collection of multi-appellation blends. Each glass of Ghost Pines wine illustrates the diverse topography, soil and climate of California’s most notable winegrowing regions.The art and science of winemaking at Ghost Pines begins in the vineyard. That vineyard spans counties and appellations, meandering across hills and valleys, blooming under sun-drenched skies and rolling fog. Our winemakers vary in climate, soil, elevation and proximity to the Pacific Ocean.

 Vampire Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,North Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$12.19,$9.99,"The year was 1985, and it was pitch dark on a rural highway somewhere in the Nevada desert.  The only visible lights were the stars up above, when Michael Machat first saw the vision  across the sky.  The image was red wine, and the name was Vampire. Some 3000 miles later Machat emerged in NY eager to share what, he thought, was a brilliant idea.  Unfortunately the reaction from the wine trade was  disbelief.  “A wine named Vampire?  What was this young New York lawyer thinking?” At that time the notion of calling a  wine Vampire®, let alone describing it as the Blood of the Vine!® was downright silly if not irreverent.  Wine was meant to be taken seriously; it wasn’t meant for playing games.Not perturbed by the skeptics, the idea stayed with him.   Transylvania was the logical choice, but at the time it was ruled by the communist dictator Ceausescu, and marketing was illegal.   They too weren’t interested in Machat’s ideas.  But the power of the vision stayed with him.Later that year music/trademark attorney, Michael Machat, visited  London for what was supposed to be a four week business trip.  It was here that he met the girl who would become the future Countess to Vampire wines, and his wife to this day - British beauty musician/writer Lisa Dominique.  Michael’s one month stay in England lasted 7 years and in 1990, Michael married English rock star Lisa Dominique.While representing artists in England, Machat didn’t give up on his vision.   Since Transylvania wasn’t an option, he began elsewhere.  In 1988, while living in London, he released the first Vampire wine, a full bodied Algerian Syrah bottled in France.   Next was an Italian Sangiovese, which found its way back home to the Anne Rice Fan Club in New Orleans.It wasn’t until 1990 when the Berlin Wall was torn down and the Romanian people executed their leader that Michael began his early trips to Transylvania seeking a winery for his concept. It wasn’t easy. Marketing had been unlawful for 45 years and the Romanians had no appreciation for the western world’s notion of a vampire. Many vintners were too proud to allow Machat to brand their wine as he envisioned. They had a different understanding of vampires, and convincing them that the idea would work was surprisingly not simple.In 1995, one decade after that road trip, Michael brought his  vision to life. He had at long last found a home for his idea in Transylvania.  From the soil and roots of the legendary Count Dracula, Vampire had arisen and the true blood of the vine was born.Over two decades have passed since that first production of Vampire wine in Transylvania, and we are proud to say it has been a wonderful journey of making our wines the best that they can be.  Along the way, both Michael and Lisa’s palates matured. They began demanding better and better wine for their Vampire Brand.So in 2007, the Machat family uprooted their connections in Transylvania and moved their wine production to California where they reside. The first California production was produced in Paso Robles. The following year the Machats began expanding the Vampire range, adding  Dracula and Trueblood to their upper range of wines.With an unyielding thirst for even more distinctive and sophisticated wines, the Machats established a winery up in Napa where they produce Cabernet Sauvignon,  Pinot Noir, and Chardonnay. In May 2014, their Trueblood Mt.

 Redstone Meadery Nectar Of Hops,United States,Colorado,N/A,N/A,Still wine,,$17.99,"David Myers, known as ’Chairman of the Mead’, founder of Redstone Meadery, is a romantic and wants to see mead once again enjoying the glory days of yesteryear. He started the Boulder, Colorado company with the ’natural philosophy’ that he produce the highest quality honey wine on the market.Because of this ’philosophy of mead’, Redstone does not cork (to avoid oxidation) but instead uses swing top bottles. This ensures the mead will not breathe while cellaring plus offers a much longer shelf life once the bottle has been opened.In keeping with the ’natural’ approach, Redstone does not add any sulfites, a known allergen, as honey is its own natural preservative. Redstone only pasteurizes the must (unfermented mead) and never boils. The company strives to feature the flavors of the fermentable as much as possible.In 2003 Redstone Meadery brought the International Mead Festival (www.meadfest.com) to Boulder, Colorado and with that helped to establish mead as its own beverage category. Also at this time Redstone spearheaded the creation of the International Mead Association (www.meadfest.org) to help promote and educate the masses about the world’s first fermented beverage.Currently, Redstone products are distributed to 30 states across the U.S., making it the widest distributed wine from the state of Colorado and one of the most widely distributed meads in the country!

 Peter Mertes Riesling Platinum,Germany,Pfalz,N/A,Riesling,Still wine,,$9.99,"In 1924 the winery owner and master winemaker Peter Mertes established his business in a small village called Minheim on the Mosel. His intention was to go beyond the simple wine-growing which can be documented for more than 600 years in the Mertes family. Peter Mertes had a clear goal: he wanted to supply his wine directly to his customers. The basis of this young venture were his extensive vineyards between the well-known wine towns of Bernkastel and Piesport on the Mosel.In the 1950s his son-in-law Dr. Gustav Willkomm began activities at the renowned wine sites on the Rhine (Nierstein, Oppenheim, Bingen, Mainz) and a little later in the Pfalz.In the 1960s the range was extended to include wines from the Rheingau and the Nahe. Through these offerings the customers and markets grew, today Peter Mertes wine is found in all parts of Germany and in many foreign markets. In addition to the Mosel vineyards which are constantly expanding, various wine cellars, bottling plants and modern, air-conditioned warehouses were established during the 1970s and 1980s. Today the company includes, for example, the biggest barrique cellar in Germany exclusively for German red wines, as well as prominent wine estates with prime vineyards.In the early days of industrialisation the pleasure of wine was a privilege of the upper classes. The vision of Peter Mertes was to appeal to a broad section of the population with select, sophisticated wines of the best quality. This still drives us today and is the basis of our company ethos. Recent years have seen a successful expansion in the Eastern European and Asian countries particularly with quality German wines. With several hundred employees in various locations, anologists, cellarmasters, viticulture specialists, sales and marketing professionals, Peter Mertes offers a wide range for wine lovers at home and abroad.

 Trentadue Old Patch Red,United States,California,N/A,Non-Varietal Red Blend,Still wine,,$12.99,"The Trentadue family arrived in Sonoma County long before the region gained a reputation as the Wine Country. Life-long, hands-on agriculturists, Evelyn and Leo Trentadue contributed significantly to the advancement of their region over the years. In 1959, the Trentadues decided to flee the developers encroaching on their apricot and cherry orchards in Sunnyvale, the area known today around the world as Silicon Valley. To preserve their way of life, these hard-working Italian ranchers purchased 208 acres of land in Sonoma County’s then remote Alexander Valley.There was little market for the region’s dry-farmed apples, prunes, pears, and grapes in the late 1950s, so land was cheap and plentiful. Scores of ranches were for sale but, because it was blessed with an excellent combination of climate, soil, and water, Leo settled on a special piece of property in the heart of the Alexander Valley. Little did he know what this ranch had once been, much less what it was to become.The piece of land, which is now home to Trentadue Winery, has a remarkable history. In 1868, a French botanist named Andrew Bouton established Heart’s Desire Nursery on this excellent site east of the railroad tracks. With a passion for breeding new and improved strains of fruit trees, Bouton devoted himself to plant propagation, becoming a major supplier of young tree stock to orchardists throughout the western United States. His reputation attracted the attention of a young man named Luther Burbank who visited Bouton frequently. Influenced by Bouton, Burbank conducted his own work in nearby Sebastopol and Santa Rosa.Shaping the Trentadue Estate Vineyards and WineryLeo Trentadue has a reputation for openness to new ideas. Over the years, this inveterate tinkerer has been among the first to experiment with what resulted in a number of viticultural/wine industry innovations. An overview of his unheralded achievements: From dry farming to irrigation. Horse drawn plows and dry farming were still practiced when the Trentadues arrived in the Alexander Valley. Leo introduced advanced irrigation practices common to his former home in Santa Clara County.The Trentadues were among the very first to plant new vines in Sonoma County since the days of Prohibition. Italians love their red wines, especially hearty reds like Carignane. In 1962, the Trentadue family began planting new Carignane vines in addition to the 68 acres of old vines already growing on their ranch. Now more than 115 years old, these vines are among the oldest producing Carignane vineyards in America. The family remains steadfastly devoted to this grape, and their wine ranks indisputably among just a handful of top ranked California Carignane. These vines continue to provide valuable character in many of our award winning wines.Understanding the importance of growing only those grape varieties, which excelled in his vineyards, in 1974 Leo installed half-acre blocks of eight different varietals. The quality of the Sangiovese was extraordinary, so all other vines were replanted to this famed variety from Tuscany. Because Evelyn and Leo share a Tuscan heritage, it is not surprising that in 1984 Trentadue was the first producer to release a 100% varietal wine named for this famed grape of Italy. The superior quality of this fruit has produced our most popular Tasting Room wine and has been the backbone for our La Storia Cuvee 32 blend, which is consistently one of the top wines produced from the Trentadue Estate.Leo had produced an incredible, award-winning 1973 Angelica and finally, in 1987, he encouraged his winemaker to experiment with fortified wines. An excellent Petite Sirah Port resulted, among the very first of its kind. The wine was well received, so a Merlot Port and eventually a Zinfandel Port were added to the line. Over the years, Trentadue has become the leading producer of dessert wines in the area, including the wildly popular Chocolate Amore.Connection to Ridge VineyardsThis winery’s story cannot be told without mention of the Trentadues’ remarkable long-term relationship with Paul Draper of Ridge Vineyards. Their personal history began in 1952 when the Trentadues became Paul’s neighbor in Santa Clara, after buying an old abandoned wine estate at the end of Montebello Road. Paul began buying fruit from their ancient vines, striking up a friendship which continues to this day.Both Draper and the Trentadues know a good thing when they see it. Draper was quick to benefit from the Trentadues’ aptitude for viticulture. The Trentadues have similarly benefited from Draper’s wine business savvy. Indeed, it is Draper who encouraged the family to take advantage of their location and establish an estate winery.The list of mutual benefits derived from the Trentadue and Ridge association is extensive: Fruit from the Trentadues’ Geyserville estate has been sold to Ridge Vineyards every vintage since 1967. In 1974, Ridge Vineyard acquired the Trentadues’ mountaintop winery and vineyard today known as Montebello. Victor Trentadue manages not only 99 plus acres of his family’s estate-owned fruit contracted to Ridge, but is also entrusted to manage 188 additional acres of Dry Creek Valley grapes under contract nearby to Draper.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Talbott Kali Hart Pinot Noir,United States,California,Monterey County,Pinot Noir,Still wine,$22.59,$16.99,"In 1982, Robb Talbott began planting his original Diamond T Estate vineyard on a cold, windswept mountaintop in Carmel Valley. Conventional wisdom was against him, and many said the steep, exposed site with its massive shale boulders was “too cold,” “too difficult to plant” and “too challenging to grow on.” But Robb had a vision-a vision he held on to as he prepared the cliff-side vineyard by hand, breaking apart its massive boulders with a 12-pound sledgehammer. “It all began with my first taste of a great Burgundy,” says Robb.Diamond T Vineyard Map “That experience profoundly shaped my palate, and as I grew older I knew that I wanted to create unique and exceptional Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs. Wines that took their inspiration from the traditions of Burgundy, but had their roots in California’s soils.”To achieve this goal, Robb Talbott established one of the Central Coast’s most esteemed estate programs, featuring two of Monterey County’s grand cru sites: Diamond T Estate and the legendary Sleepy Hollow Vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands. Though located a mere 18 miles apart, these two vineyards offer remarkably different growing conditions, yielding rich and distinctive Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs that embody their unique terroirs.At its heart, the history of Talbott Vineyards is the story of one family’s determined focus and commitment to excellence. In 1950, Robert Talbott, Sr., his wife Audrey, and their son, Robb, moved to Carmel, California, where they started a luxury tie company. Audrey sewed the ties by hand and Robert, Sr. sold them up and down the California coast. During silk buying trips to Europe for their business, the Talbotts visited French and Italian vineyards and soon became interested in fine wine. As their interest grew, they aspired to produce their own California wines, using the Burgundian techniques that they had become passionate about.Diamond T ShaleIn 1982, Robb planted Diamond T, and the Talbotts built their original winery in idyllic Carmel Valley. For his first plantings, Robb selected the storied Corton-Charlemagne Chardonnay clone, planting it in Diamond T’s almost soil-free chalky shale. Robb knew that the vines would have to struggle to survive at Diamond T, producing miniscule yields and wines of great intensity.After years of working with fruit from Sleepy Hollow Vineyard, in 1994 the Talbotts achieved another important milestone when they were able to acquire the property-making Talbott an all-estate winery. Featuring blocks of old Wente clone vines planted in 1972, Sleepy Hollow has earned a reputation for producing wines of great depth and voluptuousness. Today, Sleepy Hollow’s River Road block is home to the winery’s state-of-the-art winemaking facility, where Robb Talbott and renowned winemaker Dan Karlsen guide Talbott’s storied Chardonnay and Pinot Noir programs. These estate wines have gained a reputation for their lushness, grace and great aging potential, and have become benchmarks of quality on the Central Coast..",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

The chateau was plundered and burned down during the Fronde insurrection, then rebuilt in the 17th century. It was re-named Cru du Roy in the late 18th century on being taken over by a nephew of the Suduiraut family, Jean Joseph Duroy, Baron of Noaillan. The family home then acquired a cartouche featuring the Suduiraut and Duroy coats of arms, which was to give rise to the escutcheon used by Chateau Suduiraut today. The property was planted with magnificent formal gardens, designed by Le Notre, King Louis XIV’s renowned gardener. On 18 April 1855 the estate was classed as a Premier Cru during the official wine classification programme in the Gironde winegrowing area. AXA Millesimes acquired Suduiraut in 1992 with the aim of preserving and perpetuating the estate’s remarkable tradition of vineyard management and winemaking.

Sensing opportunity in Europe’s pain, the three founders of Chateau Tanunda built a Bavarian-style Chateau dedicated to the production of fine quality wines.This grand vision would become for a while the largest winemaking facility in the Southern Hemisphere.European immigrants had been planting vines in the Barossa since the 1840s, so the region was a natural choice. The resulting wines, made from grapes produced by 560 local growers (paid a pound per gallon – a substantial sum at the time), were transported on company-owned ships to a wine-starved Europe.Chateau Tanunda’s success was the Barossa’s success. For years it was the heart of Barossa winemaking. A veritable “Ivy League” of Australian winemakers worked or studied at the facility, including Max Schubert, the creator of Grange Hermitage; Prof. Soebels, Australia’s first qualified enologist; Bill Seppelt; Grant Burge; Geoff Merrill and others. In 1994, in recognition of its rich history, Chateau Tanunda was placed on the Register of State Heritage Places – but by then its glory days were a memory.Abandoned by its then owner, Australian wine giant Southcorp, the property was a shell of its former grandeur. When John Geber chanced upon it in 1998, and bought it a day later, he embraced the challenge of restoring this magnificent property to its iconic status.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Silver Oak Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$172.59,$119.99,"It All Began With a HandshakeSilver Oak began over a handshake between two friends with a bold vision: focus on one varietal, Cabernet Sauvignon, aged exclusively in American oak and worthy of cellaring for decades to come.Our FoundersRaymond Twomey Duncan, a Colorado entrepreneur who began investing in California vineyards in the late 1960s, and Justin Meyer, a winemaker and former Christian Brother, began in a Napa Valley dairy barn in 1972, producing only 1,100 cases of their inaugural vintage.Over the next two decades, Silver Oak grew in popularity. Our Napa Valley and Alexander Valley Cabernets sold quickly upon their release from the winery and became a sought-after staple on restaurant wine lists around the country. After selecting Daniel Baron to succeed him as winemaker in 1994, Justin retired, selling his share of Silver Oak to the Duncan family in 2001.With David R. Duncan serving as President and CEO and Tim Duncan as Executive Vice President, the Duncan family continues to operate the winery to this day.“We Rebuild”In 2006, a fire destroyed our historic Oakville winery. It was a difficult and emotional event; but in hindsight, a blessing in disguise. When we regrouped on the morning of the fire, we knew we had to rebuild, and it wasn’t long before the excitement of a new, state-of-the-art winery overcame our sense of loss.Today, we are applying this experience from our LEED Platinum Oakville winery toward a new winery in the Alexander Valley. Set amidst 70 acres of estate vineyards along the rolling foothills of the Mayacamas mountains, our new Alexander Valley winery - set to open for harvest 2017 - will push industry design and innovation standards through alternative energy sources, innovative water reuse systems and reclaimed building materials.Continuous Improvement“We have yet to make our best bottle of wine,” or the idea that our best wines are still ahead of us, is a philosophy that guides everything we do. In 2015, we became the first North American winery to own and operate an American oak cooperage, giving us full control over the quality of our barrelmaking needs.Today, we farm more than 400 acres of vines in Napa Valley and Alexander Valley with a leading-edge approach toward precision viticulture, allowing us to give our vines exactly what they need, when they need it. All of our estate vineyards are certified under California’s Sustainable Winegrowing program.In 2014, Nate Weis joined us as only the third winemaker in our 45-year history. Nate worked side-by-side with Daniel Baron, just as Daniel worked with Justin Meyer before his retirement. These overlapping tenures ensure the handing down of our commitment to continuous improvement and the wisdom that our best wines are still ahead of us.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Pascual Toso Estate Malbec,Argentina,Cuyo,Mendoza,Malbec,Still wine,$11.99,$9.99,"When in the mid 1880s Pascual Toso set out towards Argentina from its home town, Canale D’Alba, in Piamonte, Italy, he could not have imagined that he would become the founder of a winery, which is today one of the oldest and most prestigious wineries in Argentina. When he arrived in Argentina, he settled in Mendoza. As he had been closely involved in the development of his family wine business in Piedmont, he promptly saw the promising future for winemaking in the region and decided to use his expertise. Thus, in 1890, Pascual Toso established his first winery in San Jose, Guaymallen. At the beginning of the 20th century, he decided to expand his business and acquired vineyards in Maipu. At his estate “Las Barrancas”, he built another winery, “Las Barrancas” (small Canyon) which is dedicated to producing and growing the finest grapes. In 2001, the Bodega hired as winemaker consultant to Mr. Paul Hobbs for a new high quality wine project. He has been working head to head with our chief winemaker, Rolando Luppino, on the development of premium and super-premium wines. Today, Pascual Toso still makes wines of high quality under the most exigent procedures and rules. The Trophy for Best Argentine Producer awarded by the IWSC (London) in 2007 reflects this commitment to quality. Today, the brand benefits of a real success in the national market but also worldwide. The Bodega has gained 12 years of experience in exporting to international markets and the wines are available in more than 30 markets such as United Kingdom, USA, Japan, Europe, Russia, Korea, Canada and Latin America. The most important is our passion for the wines and the quality we try to achieve. Since 1890, Bodegas y Vinedos Pascual Toso has become one of the most exciting and promising Argentine wineries and remains faithful to its principles: Tradition, Authenticity, Innovation.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 14 Hands Merlot,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Merlot,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"
 Talbott Kali Hart Chardonnay,United States,California,Monterey County,Chardonnay,Still wine,$20.99,$15.99,"In 1982, Robb Talbott began planting his original Diamond T Estate vineyard on a cold, windswept mountaintop in Carmel Valley. Conventional wisdom was against him, and many said the steep, exposed site with its massive shale boulders was “too cold,” “too difficult to plant” and “too challenging to grow on.” But Robb had a vision-a vision he held on to as he prepared the cliff-side vineyard by hand, breaking apart its massive boulders with a 12-pound sledgehammer. “It all began with my first taste of a great Burgundy,” says Robb.Diamond T Vineyard Map “That experience profoundly shaped my palate, and as I grew older I knew that I wanted to create unique and exceptional Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs. Wines that took their inspiration from the traditions of Burgundy, but had their roots in California’s soils.”To achieve this goal, Robb Talbott established one of the Central Coast’s most esteemed estate programs, featuring two of Monterey County’s grand cru sites: Diamond T Estate and the legendary Sleepy Hollow Vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands. Though located a mere 18 miles apart, these two vineyards offer remarkably different growing conditions, yielding rich and distinctive Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs that embody their unique terroirs.At its heart, the history of Talbott Vineyards is the story of one family’s determined focus and commitment to excellence. In 1950, Robert Talbott, Sr., his wife Audrey, and their son, Robb, moved to Carmel, California, where they started a luxury tie company. Audrey sewed the ties by hand and Robert, Sr. sold them up and down the California coast. During silk buying trips to Europe for their business, the Talbotts visited French and Italian vineyards and soon became interested in fine wine. As their interest grew, they aspired to produce their own California wines, using the Burgundian techniques that they had become passionate about.Diamond T ShaleIn 1982, Robb planted Diamond T, and the Talbotts built their original winery in idyllic Carmel Valley. For his first plantings, Robb selected the storied Corton-Charlemagne Chardonnay clone, planting it in Diamond T’s almost soil-free chalky shale. Robb knew that the vines would have to struggle to survive at Diamond T, producing miniscule yields and wines of great intensity.After years of working with fruit from Sleepy Hollow Vineyard, in 1994 the Talbotts achieved another important milestone when they were able to acquire the property-making Talbott an all-estate winery. Featuring blocks of old Wente clone vines planted in 1972, Sleepy Hollow has earned a reputation for producing wines of great depth and voluptuousness. Today, Sleepy Hollow’s River Road block is home to the winery’s state-of-the-art winemaking facility, where Robb Talbott and renowned winemaker Dan Karlsen guide Talbott’s storied Chardonnay and Pinot Noir programs. These estate wines have gained a reputation for their lushness, grace and great aging potential, and have become benchmarks of quality on the Central Coast..",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Alba Riesling,United States,New Jersey,N/A,Riesling,Still wine,$13.69,$12.99,"Wine growing is all about site selection. Quality wine comes from prime vineyard sites.  Elevation, soil/air drainage, soil composition, and climate are all very important factors into cultivar selection.  Alba’s 93-acre estate is nestled in the rolling hills of Warren County, specifically on the north side of the Musconetcong river valley, a tributary of the Delaware river.  We are a part of the Warren Hills AVA where our vineyard rests between the elevations of 250’ and 650’ above sea level providing the farm with ample drainage of cold air; which helps to mitigate spring frosts and prolong our growing season. All of our vineyards blocks are on sloped terrain, varying from 5% to 30% grade, coupled with the southern exposure this provides our vines with all the sunlight exposure they could ever need.  This farm dates back to the late 1700’s, originally a dairy farm, our vineyards are the first cultivation of the land. This means the soils are as healthy as they can possible be and were never subject to years of other farming and depletion of nutrients.We believe in the value of vineyard ownership as a means of producing wines of exceptional quality, distinctive character, and consistency year after year.

 Baron Herzog Pinot Grigio,United States,California,N/A,Pinot Gris,Still wine,,$10.99,"The Jewish people have a special relationship to wine that predates even the Romans and Greeks. For the ancient Jews, whose temple in Jerusalem was renowned throughout the fledgling civilizations of the Middle East, wine played an important role in religious ritual. Today, thousands of years later, it continues to do so. Kiddush, the prayer over the wine, traditionally announces the beginning of the Sabbath on Friday night as well as other holidays.And so it should come as no surprise that the Herzog family has been making wine for a long time. They trace their winemaking origins back to Philip Herzog, who made wine in Slovakia for the Austro-Hungarian court more than a century ago. Philip’s wines were so appreciated by Emperor Franz-Josef, that the emperor made Philip a baron. The Baron Herzog wines-a line of premium yet moderately priced California varietals-are named to commemorate the honor.Baron Philip made both kosher and non-kosher wines. The kosher wines were made in a separate cellar and tasted remarkably like his non-kosher wines. Indeed, the wines were made in the same basic manner. However, the kosher wines required a Jewish, Sabbath-observant cellar crew.During World War II, Philip’s grandson Eugene hid his family from the Nazis by moving them around the Slovakian countryside. After the war’s end, he emerged from behind a false wall in a courageous Christian friend’s woodshed to reclaim his family’s winery.But three years later, the new Czech communist regime drove the Herzogs away from their European home for good. Forced to leave with little more than the clothes on their backs, the family said goodbye to their former royal economic and social stature.Eugene brought the family to America in 1948 after the Holocaust.  He arrived in New York City with his wife, Sidonia, six of his own children and two additional war orphans. They moved to the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn with only enough money to rent a two-bedroom tenement flat. With his winemaking skills, Eugene found a job at a small kosher winery tucked away into a storefront on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. For a paltry salary, he made sweet, Concord-grape wines in the cellar. (European grape varieties for dry wines were not easy to obtain in post World War II New York.) He also drove the wine delivery truck. But because the company was so poor, he was paid for his driving acumen in company shares, not cash.For years the shares were worthless, but by 1958, all the other shareholders had given up their shares. They assumed the business was doomed to failure. Eugene and his sons, who all went to work at the winery, proved them wrong. They called their new venture Royal Wines, in deference to their grandfather, Philip.In 1985, the Herzog family decided to expand their winemaking operations to California, where they make wine under two separate labels: Baron Herzog and Herzog Wine Cellars. After twenty years of renting space in various wineries, the family was finally able to build its own state-of-the-art winery just south of Santa Barbara, in the town of Oxnard. Here, under the supervision of head winemaker Joe Hurliman, Herzog Wine Cellars has created a center for high-end contemporary winemaking in a tradition that dates back nearly six centuries.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Castello di Bossi Chianti Classico,Italy,Tuscany,Chianti,Sangiovese,Still wine,$21.99,$17.99,"The winemaking revolution which in the last few years has taken place in Chianti Classico and in Tuscan winemaking in general could hardly have left untouched as well a historic winery estate such as Castello di Bossi.Develop to the fullest extent possible the potential represented by this estate and embrace modern technology, while respecting at the same time the character of the Chianti heartland: these were the tasks we set ourselves to bring our wine house into the highest ranks of international wine.The programme took decades to come to full fruition, with the Bacci family carefully selecting the most talented staff for that purpose and setting uncompromising quality as its single most important goal.Today the Castello di Bossi covers 650 hectares , on which 124 are under vine. By utilising only the most enlightened viticultural practices, we harvest, vintage after vintage, prize fruit that represents to the fullest extent the qualities of terroir and of their individual grape varieties.Those 124 hectares planted to Sangiovese, the main variety of Chianti Classico and of Tuscany in general; and to Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, which were planted at Bossi some forty years ago, probably among the first in Chianti Classico.Their roots go deep into soils that are predominantly tuffs, yellow clays, silt-sand, and crushed rock, at an altitude of about 350 meters . These conditions, plus a unique microclimate and optimal exposition to the sun, yield grapes that are perfectly ripe, healthy, and of great character.The grapes ferment in temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks fitted with the most advanced processing systems. The wine then matures and rests in the barrel cellar, with over 1,000 light-toast French oak barrels. The state-of-the-art bottling line is temperature-controlled as well, and feeds directly into the bottle-storage facility. It, too, is fully insulated and fully cold- and heat-regulatable.Absolutely fundamental for keeping our standards of quality high is our ambitious programme of replanting, carried out on a cyclic basis and due for completion in 3-4 years.Castello di Bossi wines are distributed through a network of business partners.

 Cabreo Al Borgo,Italy,Tuscany,N/A,"Cabernet Sauvignon,Sangiovese",Still wine,$62.99,$49.99,"The grapes achieve optimum ripeness and are picked at different times: the Sangiovese first, in the first half of October and the Cabernet Sauvignon in the second half. Focus is on the most gentle treatment possible of the grapes during production. The destemming process uses two conduits rather than a screw augur, which leads into a perforated cylinder in which the skins are separated from the stems without shredding. Fermentation takes place over a period of seven to eight days in stainless steel tanks at a controlled temperature of 28º to 32ºC (79º to 89ºF). The Sangiovese is in contact with the skins for a total of seven to ten days, and the Cabernet for a period of roughly fifteen days or slightly longer. Three maceration methods are used: manual punch-down; mechanized submersion of the cap with pistons; and juice pump-over. The skins are drained and gently balloon-pressed at 1.2 atmospheres pressure. Malolactic fermentation is then carried out in stainless steel tanks at a controlled temperature of 22º to 23°C (73º to 74ºF). The two varieties are then bended and matured in French oak ""carati,"" or barriques, with racking every three months over a total period of 15 to 18 months in oak.

 14 Hands Chardonnay,United States,Washington,N/A,Chardonnay,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price.

 Sassicaia,Italy,Tuscany,Bolgheri,Bordeaux Blend,Still wine,$329.99,$299.00,"The legacy of Sassicaia begins in 1944, when Mario Incisa acquired a number of Cabernet Sauvignon and Franc vine cuttings and planted them on a sloping hillside of the San Guido estate, called Castiglioncello after the 11th-century castle at the vineyard's upper edge.  This tiny, 3.75-acre vineyard stood alone until 1965, when a second Cabernet vineyard was planted with cuttings from the Castiglioncello parcel; the gravelly, 30-acre plot would give the wine its name: Sassicaia, ""the place of many stones"".  This and a slightly more elevated microclimate of 20 acres, called Aianova, were planted in phases between 1965 and 1985, bringing plantings to the present extent of 90 acres in vines averaging 20 to 25 years of age. Since the late 1960s, Sassicaia has represented a standard of production that is without compromise.  The grapes are hand picked, destemmed, crushed and fermentation is set off by natural yeasts in stainless steel tanks.  For the first week, pumping over of the must takes place three times daily; during the second week, this is reduced to once daily until the end of the 14-day fermentation period.  The wine is pressed from the skins and undergoes full malolactic fermentation.  Aging takes place in 225-litre Allier and Tronçais oak barriques, approximately 30 percent of which are new, for 18 to 22 months depending on vintage.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 La Scolca Gavi White Label,Italy,Piedmont,Gavi,Cortese,Still wine,$19.99,$15.99,"Founded in 1919, La Scolca is the first producer of quality Gavi and ranks among the most historic white wine producers in Italy. Although Cortese had been planted in the region since the late 19th Century, the grape produced low-alcohol, thin and sour wines that quickly oxidized. Consequently, the production was mostly purchased by Cinzano and Martini & Rossi as a base for their sparkling wines. It was the Soldati family, who after the Second World War saved the fate of Cortese from oblivion by focusing entirely on the production of quality Cortese, in a region traditionally known for its reds. They pioneered modern, controlled vinification in stainless steel to preserve the subtle fruit of the Cortese grape, allowing for the creation of wines that retained crisp acidity and aromas and gained structure. Today, the Estate is run by Giorgio Soldati, the founder’s great-grandson, and his daughter, Chiara, representing the fifth generation. The Estate’s 50 hectares of vineyards are planted on the hills surrounding the family villa, in the Rovereto Superiore region of the commune of Gavi, the “Grand Cru” terroir for Cortese. Located 30-miles from the Mediterranean, marine air tempers the cool mountain air and all-day sunlight is ideal for ripening. Vineyards are planted on steep slopes at a density of 50 quintals/ha, half that allowed by the DOCG. Soils are composed of calcareous-clay and volcanic soils with iron, shot with veins of chalky limestone similar to that found in Champagne and Chablis, giving that characteristic flinty character. All of La Scolca’s white wines follow the same vinification process: hand-harvested fruit is brought to the winery after 5-10 minutes, where it is sprayed with dry ice. Cryo-maceration, cold fermentation (13-14ºC) and the use of natural yeasts preserves the Cortese’s subtle fruit, flinty acidity and structure. With Piedmont’s oldest Cortese vines (60+ years) and decades of pioneering, family winemaking tradition, La Scolca produces spectacular, complex and concentrated age-worthy wines now found on the world’s finest wine lists. The 2014 vintage will mark La Scolca’s 95th harvest. La Scolca adheres to European Union Regulation 2078/92, which encourages conversion to organic farming practices to reduce carbon footprint and other negative impact on the environment from both farming and vinification. Some practices include: no use of pesticides and minimal use of chemicals in the cellar; water used in the winery is filtered three times and recycled.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Home’s original philosophy to offer ”a great product for a fair price,” even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

The barrels range in age from one to two years old, and the majority of the wine is aged in the older barrels. The barrel-fermented component is periodically stirred, a process called ""bâtonnage,"" to redistribute the lees, which enriches the wine's texture and helps integrate the fruit flavors with the oak nuances.

At the winery, hand sorting begins on our custom-built shaker table.  Pinot Noir clusters are dispersed and gently conveyed to the next sorting table where six sorters assess the clusters that will be allowed to pass to the fermenters.FERMENTATION AND CELLARINGAt Flowers, Pinot-Noir is partially de-stemmed  to provide a 75% whole-berry environment in our small open-top fermenters.  Pinot Noir is cold-soaked for five to seven days at a temperature of 45° F and the hand-punching-down begins.  After the cold-soak period, the fermenter is warmed to 68 °F to 85 °F and wild yeast carries the fermentation to showcase the terroir and complexity.  Once fermentation is complete the wines are left in contact with the skins for 10-15 days to further enhance flavor and color development.Free-run wines are drained using natural gravity flow to French oak barrels and the remaining skins are gently pressed in a small traditional basket press.  All wines are aged between 14-16 months in small French oak barrels from Burgundian Coopers.   Our philosophy is to retain all of the natural vineyard elements while hand-crafting our Pinot Noir.

Carmel owns the two largest wineries in Israel, at Rishon Le Zion, south of Tel Aviv and at Zichron Ya’acov, south of Haifa. Each has deep underground cellars built by Rothschild in the 19th century.The story of Carmel represents the story of Israel, and the recent developments of Carmel’s wine, symbolizes the revolution of Israeli wine in recent years.Carmel Winery has 3,472 acres of vineyards, which cover the land of Israel from the Upper Galilee in the north, to the Negev in the south. Carmel’s winemakers can therefore choose from vineyards with different terroirs from all the wine regions in Israel. Carmel has a particularly strong vineyard presence in the cooler climate of the Upper Galilee, from where many of the leading wines are sourced.Carmel’s Rishon Le Zion Wine Cellars, built in 1890, is the oldest winery in Israel still in use. Two future Israeli prime ministers worked there and the first ever use of electricity and telephone in Israel was at the winery. Rishon Le Zion is now the fourth biggest city in Israel and it has literally grown around the winery, which sits in the center of a residential area. Carmel’s main blending & bottling facility is at Rishon Le Zion, which is also where the company’s head office is located.Carmel’s Zichron Ya’acov Wine Cellars, built in 1892, is the largest winery in Israel. On the premises is a modern, state-of-the-art facility making small quantities of quality wines from Carmel’s finest vineyards. The most advanced, modern winemaking technology blends in with the historic 120 year old cellars. The name of the winery is in memory of Edmond de Rothschild’s father, Baron James Jacob (Ya’acov) de Rothschild, who purchased the famous Bordeaux winery, Chateau Lafite, for the Rothschild family. Zichron Ya’acov is a charming town which still has an atmosphere of pre-state Israel. It is situated south of Haifa on the southern slopes of Mount Carmel, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.Lior Lacser is the Chief Winemaker of Carmel Winery.

While still maintaining grape sales to top wineries around the world, they brought award-winning winemaker Steve Millier aboard to launch Kautz wines, which would evolve into Ironstone Vineyards, a wine brand dedicated to the production of exceptional wines of unparalleled quality, outstanding value and everyday approachability. The next big step for Ironstone was the creation of a “homesite,” a winery and visitors center that would exemplify the Kautz family commitment to excellence, and provide an environment that would reach beyond the world of winemaking to include the support all of the cultural arts.In 1989, using dynamite, pick axes and shovels, a crew of miners carved through limestone and Calaveras Schist Rock on Gail’s family ranch in Murphys, California and fashioned the site of Ironstone’s wine aging caverns, which in the beginning, also served as the facility’s first tasting room. Humble beginnings for what has now become California’s largest winery entertainment complex.Over the years, Ironstone Wines and the Ironstone Winery have each grown and become famous in their own way.

 Sandeman Tawny Port,Portugal,Duriense,Douro - Porto,Port Blend,Still wine,,$16.99,"The House of Sandeman was founded in London in 1790 by George Sandeman, a young Scot from Perth who decided to invest £300 borrowed from his father in creating a business marketing wines from Porto (Portugal) and Jerez (Spain ). The innovation revealed from the outset, would eventually carry Sandeman to a notable position in the wine and spirit sector, and the company is today undoubtedly one of the most recognized brands in the world. Always a pioneer, Sandeman was the first company to brand its name on a cask with a hot iron. In 1805, the GSC (George Sandeman Co.) signature was a guarantee of quality for the wine it sold. It was also one of the first companies to label and advertise its wines, which in the early nineteenth century were already being exported to several countries in Europe, North and South America, Africa and Asia. The ”Sandeman Don” is one of the world’s first ever brand images and the first major icon in the wine world. It was painted in 1928 by George Massiot Brown and, with its Coimbra (Portuguese) student’s black cape and the typical Jerez (Spanish) ”sombrero”, it still retains all its mystique and attractiveness, to represent the seduction and mystery of the Sandeman brand. Sandeman’s international success was underlined in 1990 with the launch of a more modern portfolio and a new advertising campaign that emphasised a less traditional, younger and more innovative ”Don”. In 2002, Sogrape Vinhos incorporated Sandeman into its business, reinforcing its status as a major international operator in the wine sector with one more truly global brand in its portfolio. For over two centuries, Sandeman has based its success on a rare capacity for innovation and expertise handed down from generation to generation. Currently, Sandeman clearly stands out as ”the” worldwide Port Wine and Sherry brand and proudly signs: ”Sandeman, Famous for Pleasure.”",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Sutter Home 4-Pack Moscato,United States,California,N/A,Muscat Blanc A Petits Grains,Still wine,,$6.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the world’s leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Mario’s son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Home’s original philosophy to offer ”a great product for a fair price,” even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Ghost Pines Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,N/A,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$22.69,$16.99,"PHILOSOPHYAt the heart of every glass of Ghost Pines is the notion that world-class wines are made from quality grapes – grapes that span many appellations. An unconventional view against today’s backdrop of single-appellation wines, the Ghost Pines philosophy is a modern take on visionary winemaker Louis M. Martini’s approach to winemaking. In the 1930s, Martini didn’t think about appellation boundaries. He simply sought the best grapes from the best vineyards to craft his unforgettable wines, long before American Viticulture Areas (AVAs) were established in California.Seventy-five years later, Napa’s historic Louis M. Martini Winery launched Ghost Pines to give Michael Eddy and a talented group of forward-thinking winemakers the freedom to blend the finest grapes across appellations. The result is a collection of sophisticated wines that illustrate the best characteristics of each varietal and region, balancing elegance with structure, intensity with nuance.Echoing the unharnessed, free-form character of its namesake tree, Ghost Pines embodies the progressive spirit of California winemaking: no boundaries, no limits. APPELLATIONSThe wines of Ghost Pines draw a veritable map of some of California’s most renowned wine appellations. Vintner Michael Eddy and his team of progressive winemakers search for the best grapes in Napa, Sonoma, Monterey and San Joaquin counties to make a remarkable collection of multi-appellation blends. Each glass of Ghost Pines wine illustrates the diverse topography, soil and climate of California’s most notable winegrowing regions.The art and science of winemaking at Ghost Pines begins in the vineyard. That vineyard spans counties and appellations, meandering across hills and valleys, blooming under sun-drenched skies and rolling fog.

 Sandeman Rich Madeira,Portugal,Terras Madeirenses,Madeira - Madeirense,Madeira Blend,Still wine,,$21.99,"The House of Sandeman was founded in London in 1790 by George Sandeman, a young Scot from Perth who decided to invest £300 borrowed from his father in creating a business marketing wines from Porto (Portugal) and Jerez (Spain ). The innovation revealed from the outset, would eventually carry Sandeman to a notable position in the wine and spirit sector, and the company is today undoubtedly one of the most recognized brands in the world. Always a pioneer, Sandeman was the first company to brand its name on a cask with a hot iron. In 1805, the GSC (George Sandeman Co.) signature was a guarantee of quality for the wine it sold. It was also one of the first companies to label and advertise its wines, which in the early nineteenth century were already being exported to several countries in Europe, North and South America, Africa and Asia. The ”Sandeman Don” is one of the world’s first ever brand images and the first major icon in the wine world. It was painted in 1928 by George Massiot Brown and, with its Coimbra (Portuguese) student’s black cape and the typical Jerez (Spanish) ”sombrero”, it still retains all its mystique and attractiveness, to represent the seduction and mystery of the Sandeman brand. Sandeman’s international success was underlined in 1990 with the launch of a more modern portfolio and a new advertising campaign that emphasised a less traditional, younger and more innovative ”Don”. In 2002, Sogrape Vinhos incorporated Sandeman into its business, reinforcing its status as a major international operator in the wine sector with one more truly global brand in its portfolio. For over two centuries, Sandeman has based its success on a rare capacity for innovation and expertise handed down from generation to generation. Currently, Sandeman clearly stands out as ”the” worldwide Port Wine and Sherry brand and proudly signs: ”Sandeman, Famous for Pleasure.”",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the world’s leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Mario’s son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Home’s original philosophy to offer ”a great product for a fair price,” even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

The Zonda Valley is dry and hot with riverbed shingles and pudding stones that run two meters deep and radiate heat throughout the valley. This soil composition is quite extreme already, but the terroir is also transformed by temperature variations spanning 50 degrees over the course of a day in the height of summer. The grapes that are harvested in January (the southern hemisphere’s equivalent of July) which is relatively early compared to other producers in the region.

 Once Upon A Vine A Charming Pinot Noir,United States,California,N/A,Pinot Noir,Still wine,$15.19,$11.99,"Our Pinot Noir comes from several vineyards throughout California. Similar to the fairytale, we did in fact search the land for the perfect fit. We were looking for Pinot Noir with expressive varietal character that leaned toward a richer, riper black currant profile. We found it in a variety of sites, each vineyard imparting distinctive regional notes for depth and complexity.Gentle handling of the Pinot Noir from the vineyard to the bottle maintained the wine’s bright, lively fruit profile.

 Elios Mediterranean Red,Greece,Peloponnesos,N/A,"Agiorgitiko,Cabernet Sauvignon,Syrah",Still wine,,$9.99,"The Boutari Winery, founded in 1879 by Yiannis Boutari, represents something very special to the Greek wine industry. The original winery, outside of Naoussa, has a 124-acre vineyard. There are also five other wineries located throughout Greece in Goumenissa, Attica, Mantinia, Santorini, and Crete. Resurrecting the unique qualities of the indigenous grape varieties of classical Greece, sometimes combining them with more well-known French varietals such as Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, Boutari has elevated the quality of wines from this most ancient of wine-growing countries. It is sometimes hard to believe that the history of winemaking owes so much to Greece, given that the wines of this country are rarely the focus of the wine writing of this era. Greek winemaking has gone through some very difficult times, both economic and stylistic. However, Boutari has seized the moment, and is making wines of real style and substance. They clearly have improved vineyard practices, making wines of more concentration and balance. More importantly, they have improved winemaking practices, integrating such techniques as stainless steel, cold-temperature fermentation and French oak barrel aging. Today, Boutari is the world’s number-one selling Greek wine, and has earned its place on any fine table.Over 125 Years of Wine ArtThe Boutari family embarked on their journey as vintners in 1879, in Naoussa, when Yianni Boutari founded his family’s winery, giving body and soul to his vision of a winemaking enterprise with a progressive philosophy. The first step was the creation of his signature red wine, Naoussa, followed in 1906 by the establishment of the family’s first winery facility.Generation succeeded generation, each bringing new vigor to the company while remaining steadfastly committed to the principle of quality in all areas. The primary emphasis was on Greek grape varieties for the domestic and international market. Boutari wines have become ambassadors of the Greek wine landscape, winning countless international awards. Foreign varieties are cultivated on an experimental basis in many parts of Greece, yielding marvelously unique wines. With an eye to the future, the company continues to invest in equipment and in the purchase of vine-growing land in selected areas.Today there are Boutari Estate wineries in select appellations in Greece, each one superbly situated to yield top quality wines.With respect for tradition and dedication to quality, Boutari continues to explore new horizons. From its highly successful Greek and foreign varietal wines to the outstanding vintages from its own estates, Boutari highlights and enhances the vast potential of Greek wines in Greece and abroad.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Sutter Home 4-Pack Reisling,United States,California,N/A,Riesling,Still wine,,$6.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the world’s leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Mario’s son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Home’s original philosophy to offer ”a great product for a fair price,” even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

So, Barefoot Cellars was created (Bonnie liked the name because it was easy to pronounce) and initially run out of their home. Some say the office was so small you had to go outside to change your mind. Our founders began with two big varietals that were all about bringing the fun back. California Cabernet Sauvignon and California Sauvignon Blanc. Michael and Bonnie searched for the perfect image to represent their new wine. Finally, Bonnie just rolled out some paper, stepped on the biggest inkpad she could find and left her mark. It’s been on our label ever since.Through the years, people have gone head over heels for our wine. Weve received some amazing recognition and professional awards.

 Silver Oak Cabernet Sauvignon Alexander,United States,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$113.99,$79.99,"It All Began With a HandshakeSilver Oak began over a handshake between two friends with a bold vision: focus on one varietal, Cabernet Sauvignon, aged exclusively in American oak and worthy of cellaring for decades to come.Our FoundersRaymond Twomey Duncan, a Colorado entrepreneur who began investing in California vineyards in the late 1960s, and Justin Meyer, a winemaker and former Christian Brother, began in a Napa Valley dairy barn in 1972, producing only 1,100 cases of their inaugural vintage.Over the next two decades, Silver Oak grew in popularity. Our Napa Valley and Alexander Valley Cabernets sold quickly upon their release from the winery and became a sought-after staple on restaurant wine lists around the country. After selecting Daniel Baron to succeed him as winemaker in 1994, Justin retired, selling his share of Silver Oak to the Duncan family in 2001.With David R. Duncan serving as President and CEO and Tim Duncan as Executive Vice President, the Duncan family continues to operate the winery to this day.“We Rebuild”In 2006, a fire destroyed our historic Oakville winery. It was a difficult and emotional event; but in hindsight, a blessing in disguise. When we regrouped on the morning of the fire, we knew we had to rebuild, and it wasn’t long before the excitement of a new, state-of-the-art winery overcame our sense of loss.Today, we are applying this experience from our LEED Platinum Oakville winery toward a new winery in the Alexander Valley. Set amidst 70 acres of estate vineyards along the rolling foothills of the Mayacamas mountains, our new Alexander Valley winery - set to open for harvest 2017 - will push industry design and innovation standards through alternative energy sources, innovative water reuse systems and reclaimed building materials.Continuous Improvement“We have yet to make our best bottle of wine,” or the idea that our best wines are still ahead of us, is a philosophy that guides everything we do. In 2015, we became the first North American winery to own and operate an American oak cooperage, giving us full control over the quality of our barrelmaking needs.Today, we farm more than 400 acres of vines in Napa Valley and Alexander Valley with a leading-edge approach toward precision viticulture, allowing us to give our vines exactly what they need, when they need it. All of our estate vineyards are certified under California’s Sustainable Winegrowing program.In 2014, Nate Weis joined us as only the third winemaker in our 45-year history. Nate worked side-by-side with Daniel Baron, just as Daniel worked with Justin Meyer before his retirement. These overlapping tenures ensure the handing down of our commitment to continuous improvement and the wisdom that our best wines are still ahead of us.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

Anthony narrowed their focus to Pinot noir and Chardonnay only and registered Hamilton Russell Vineyards as an Estate, committing to work only with grapes from their terroir. Extensive soil research initiated in 1994 identified 52 hectares of stony, clay-rich, shale-derived soil as optimal for the individual, origin expressive style they aim for and all plantings have now been limited to this soil type.

 Joel Gott Chardonnay Unoaked,United States,California,N/A,Chardonnay,Still wine,$18.19,$14.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the world’s leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Mario’s son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Home’s original philosophy to offer ”a great product for a fair price,” even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

He devoted the rest of his life to holistic farming and winemaking in the Willamette Valley, showcasing the region’s potential for expressive, complex and balanced Riesling and Pinot Noir.While Jimi is no longer with us, his strong commitment to biodynamic farming, his gentle approach to winemaking and his excitement for the Willamette Valley terroir live on through our wines and our team.

Employing biodynamic farming practices since 2002, we are proactively reintroducing native plants in our insectary and medicinal herb gardens for our biodynamic preparations and compost teas. In addition to our estate vineyard, winemaker Chris Williams works with a number of family growers throughout the region and in the Columbia Gorge, respecting the individuality of each site and showcasing the strengths of each vineyard through masterful blending.There have been many milestones since Brooks was founded in 1998. In 2008, we expanded our winemaking operations and purchased the 20-acre vineyard Jimi started farming in 2002. In 2012, we obtained Biodynamic certification from Demeter. In 2014, we opened a new winery and tasting room. Our welcoming tasting room, with its ample seating and wine bar, overlooks the Cascade Range and the Willamette Valley floor, perfect for gatherings with friends and family-a fitting reflection of Jimi’s vision.Brooks wines have received perennial praise in the Wine Spectator, Wine & Spirits Magazine, the Wine Advocate, Josh Raynolds ratings on Vinous, Allen Meadows’ Burghound, and beyond.

She has been making wine since she earned her enology degree in 1981, and she has probably produced a wider variety of wines than any other winemaker in Argentina. Susana was the first Argentine winemaker to be hired as a consultant to make wine outside of Argentina. She has made wine in Australia, California, Chile, France, Italy, South Africa, and Spain, and she spends a month each year in a different wine region of the world studying with local winemakers and growers. After twenty years of producing wines for others, Susana decided it was time to apply her education and experience to her own wines and put her name right on the bottle. Susana strives for balance in her wines, with layers of complexity coming from the individually fermented varietals.

 Ghost Pines Merlot,United States,California,N/A,Merlot,Still wine,$19.69,$15.99,"PHILOSOPHYAt the heart of every glass of Ghost Pines is the notion that world-class wines are made from quality grapes – grapes that span many appellations. An unconventional view against today’s backdrop of single-appellation wines, the Ghost Pines philosophy is a modern take on visionary winemaker Louis M. Martini’s approach to winemaking. In the 1930s, Martini didn’t think about appellation boundaries. He simply sought the best grapes from the best vineyards to craft his unforgettable wines, long before American Viticulture Areas (AVAs) were established in California.Seventy-five years later, Napa’s historic Louis M. Martini Winery launched Ghost Pines to give Michael Eddy and a talented group of forward-thinking winemakers the freedom to blend the finest grapes across appellations. The result is a collection of sophisticated wines that illustrate the best characteristics of each varietal and region, balancing elegance with structure, intensity with nuance.Echoing the unharnessed, free-form character of its namesake tree, Ghost Pines embodies the progressive spirit of California winemaking: no boundaries, no limits. APPELLATIONSThe wines of Ghost Pines draw a veritable map of some of California’s most renowned wine appellations. Vintner Michael Eddy and his team of progressive winemakers search for the best grapes in Napa, Sonoma, Monterey and San Joaquin counties to make a remarkable collection of multi-appellation blends. Each glass of Ghost Pines wine illustrates the diverse topography, soil and climate of California’s most notable winegrowing regions.The art and science of winemaking at Ghost Pines begins in the vineyard. That vineyard spans counties and appellations, meandering across hills and valleys, blooming under sun-drenched skies and rolling fog. Our winemakers vary in climate, soil, elevation and proximity to the Pacific Ocean. Our wines bring to life the unique characteristics of each appellation.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"
 William Hill Merlot Central Coast,United States,California,Central Coast,Merlot,Still wine,$17.99,$12.99,"William Hill Estate Winery is a special place. In 1978, visionary vineyard developer William Hill saw the incredible potential of the Silverado Bench, where he built his namesake winery. More than three decades later, our winemaker Ralf Holdenried is making modern wines that speak to the unique terroir of this virtually unknown area of southern Napa Valley.A confluence of characteristics makes our 140-acre estate an ideal vineyard. Set on a benchland - off the valley floor, but below the steeper slopes of the hills - with a southwestern exposure, the vines bask in abundant sunlight. The vineyard is close to the valley floor climatically, but the volcanic soil and the size and vigor of the vines means William Hill is more like a mountaintop vineyard.

With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the world’s leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company.

Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions.

Great attention has been given to the bottle study giving distinctiveness and authority to the product; finally the use of Santero logo in relief increases value and quality to the whole product. Labels by particular shape and shading colours with attention both to every detail and to all particulars, both to the shadings and to the reflexions, give a touch of elegance to the whole bottle.Large areas grown with mono grape wine and a rich endowment of historical wine cellars dug into the tufa, of ancient farmhouse by elegant architectures, of medieval villages enhanced by churches and castles of a secular culture based on the wine production. Santero carries out its activity in a corner of Piemonte between Langhe and Monferrato: a wavy territory, lively and charming by the colour games gifts both by spontaneous plants and cultivations. Quality is not a myth of communication, but a concrete fact. In Santo Stefano Belbo Santero lives in strong contact with agriculture world that characterizes its tradition of historic wine company.

 Ramsay Cabernet,United States,California,North Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,,$15.99,"After twenty-eight years of making wine, Kent Rasmussen Winery is as busy as ever, with a few changes.Kent Rasmussen and wife, Celia Ramsay, ran the family winery they started in 1986 at their beautiful facility in St. Helena. Unlike most wineries in the Napa Valley, they never wanted to have a public presence in the form of a tasting room, but sell their wines in Bay Area & California restaurants & stores, and in 28 other states. Famous for the Kent Rasmussen and Ramsay brand wines, and best known for making “purely poetic Pinot Noir”, the couple raised their family of four on the Silverado Trail property.The kids grew up and fledged the nest, and Kent and Celia realized they longed for a more urban life. They moved their winemaking operations to share another family-run facility owned by their long-time friend, Stefano Migotto in Napa. Then they bought a home in Berkeley. With a very reasonable reverse-commute to Napa, Kent is happy to be back in the southern end of the Napa Valley, especially since his original winemaking start was in the Napa-Carneros. Kent’s passion for winemaking is as strong as ever. He has often stated that the unfortunate truth about wine is that you only get one chance a year to make it; he jokes, “I think I’m finally figuring out how it all works!” New projects for Kent include a wine brand that is sold in foreign markets only, under the label Six Eight Nine. His second passion is the Berkeley house-a Maybeck-designed home that was once owned by the Alfred Kroeber family. (Alfred Kroeber was the anthropologist famous for his work with Ishi, the last of the Yahi people of the Lassen area of California.) For those of you who are fantasy/sci-fi fiction fans, it is the house that Ursula K. LeGuin grew up in, and she claims the house made her into a writer.And even though Celia still handles the winery compliance, she has picked up an old thread in her life-music. She’s becoming well known in the Bay Area music scene as a vocalist, studio artist and songwriter, with performances at the Freight and Salvage, and many house concerts, singing both traditional folk music and 1940s style Jazz. She has two bands that she works with: Luxury Edition for Jazz, and Glamourie for Celtic-flavored folk. Celia continues to work as a professional dance teacher from Ukiah to Monterey “calling” the New England style form called Contra Dance.Since its modest beginnings in a garage in 1986, the Kent Rasmussen Winery has evolved as its owner’s lives have changed. It continues to be one of the most important Pinot Noir producers in California.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

Armed with a copy of the latest Wine Spectator, founder Kevin Mehra set out on a mission to bring higher quality wine to the market for a better price. He started calling wineries with a history of high ratings to ask if they had extra wine for sale. Some told him to get lost, but in the end, he found a handful of wineries that liked his concept. The plan was simple: we put their wine in our bottle, and sell it for less.But why would wineries want to do that?You may recall that the economy wasn’t in the best shape in 2009. Demand for wines priced more than $20 a bottle had plummeted and inventories were piling up. Rather than discount their wine and erode the value of their brand, we found that wineries were willing to part with a certain percentage of their production for a reduced price.It was a win/win scenario. Wineries got to sell more wine, and consumers got access to better wine at lower prices.The landscape has changed quite a bit since we launched; but our mission and our ability to offer great wine has not.

He established there what, at that time, was a frontier technology winery with French equipment and machinery brought directly from France. It’s aim was to supply high quality wines for the domestic market. Soon after, Adriana Piffre de Vauban, Roger´s daughter, married Roberto Echeverria Rubio, and they had one child, Roberto Echeverria. In the early 1950s, after developing diverse industries, Roberto Echeverria Rubio, established a vineyard and winery also in Molina, encouraged by the family relationship with the ongoing winery at the La Estancia estate.He grew strongly influenced by these two family winemaking activities, and developed an intense love and passion for winemaking, that would lead him to pursue university studies to obtain a degree in Agronomy and Winemaking, which he complemented soon after with Economics, obtaining a PhD at Cornell University in the US. After graduating from Cornell, Roberto worked for eight years as an economist in the World Bank. He lived in Washington D.C., together with his wife Gloria and his children, and travelled intensively worldwide. In his frequent travels, he became aware of the tremendous potential that the production of fine wines had to satisfy the growing demands of more quality-oriented consumers.In 1979 Roberto decided to return to Chile to continue his family tradition in winemaking, and to focus on emerging new market trends and opportunities. He thought he was coming back to join an ongoing winery operation, but he arrived in a country in which the wine industry was in the midst of a great depression. Many wineries had gone bankrupt, and very little wine was being exported. The family business was in jeopardy and the old winery in which he spent his summers was on the brink of disappearing.Passionate about wine, and determined to preserve his ancestors’ winemaking tradition, he embarked on the greatest challenge of his life: projecting his winery into the future, transforming it into a modern, export-oriented, and family-owned and managed operation. It would take Roberto nearly 15 years of intense conviction and sacrifice to develop these radical changes, which included replanting the entire estate and building a new winery from the ground up, and to finally bring his first wine to the international market in 1993. During the 20 years that followed he and Gloria travelled to every continent in the world, showing their wines and winning over many of the customers that are still working with them today. It was their extraordinary vision, determination and commitment to excellence, that was to make Vina Echeverria what it is today.Today Vina Echeverria is still a family-owned and managed estate winery, and its vineyards and house occupy the same location as they did nearly 100 years ago. The 65 hectares of sustainably farmed vineyards in Chile’s Central Valley are planted, tended and harvested by the Echeverria family. Roberto Echeverria is still very active in the family business and continues to inspire the whole family to develop new projects and delight new customers. Together with his four children, Paulina, Viviana, Roberto and Diego they hand-sell their wines, traveling to their 40 markets worldwide on a regular basis, and count many of their customers as friends. They form an unbeatable team bonded together by strong family roots, shared passion for winemaking, uncompromising search for excellence and dedication to their customers.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Grahams Six Grapes   Special Old Vines Edition,Portugal,Duriense,Douro - Porto,Port Blend,Still wine,,$38.99,"It has been over a hundred years since the famous Six Grapes motif was first used on a bottle of fine Port, our winemakers at W & J Graham, Charles Symington and Henry Shotton, have decided to bottle a small quantity of a special wine made exclusively from the oldest vines on Graham’s five Quintas. The presentation of this special edition Six Grapes Old Vines Port pays homage to the original Six Grapes label that helped make the wine famous so many years ago. This wine will only be available in very limited quantities.Across the five Graham’s estates we have preserved vineyards of old mixed vines, which are frequently more than forty years old. These beautiful, gnarled old vines produce immensely low yields of fruit, which grow in small, tight bunches with intense concentration and complexity.As would be expected from a wine made from such low yielding vines the Six Grapes Old Vines Port is deep purple in colour. It has complex floral aromas, redolent with rockrose, menthol and anise. The richness and opulent character of the wine is perfectly balanced by its refreshing acidity. It has great structure and concentration, with mineral notes that express the Douro’s schist soils, black plum and liquorice, all complemented by a lingering velvety smooth finish, the result of the ripe, fine grained tannins from these mature vines.Serve slightly chilled, between 16-18° C. There is no need to decant.The Six Grapes Old Vines Port is a perfect wine to pair with desserts such as cheese, dark chocolate or berry fruits. It is also ideally suited to drinking after dinner to fully appreciate its long finish and complexity.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

In 1977 an up-to-date plant, the actual premises of the Company, was opened on an area of more than 18.000 square metres situated next to the birthplace of the writer Cesare Pavese. The factory does not process only the grapes grown at the 5 Santero’s wine farms, but also the grapes bought from over three hundred local winegrowers.The production capacity of the winery is in excess of 18 million bottles per annum which is above all due to the strong presence of the main export markets.Santero has changed the packaging to modernity.

Great attention has been given to the bottle study giving distinctiveness and authority to the product; finally the use of Santero logo in relief increases value and quality to the whole product.

 Bread & Butter Pinot Noir,United States,California,N/A,Pinot Noir,Still wine,$15.99,$11.99,"This is the BREAD.The use of wood barrels for wine began thousands of years ago for storage purposes, replacing clay vessels. Wood barrels were stronger and easier to move, but originally, they did not have a specific winemaking role.  Over time, it became apparent that aging wine in wood produced positive effects in the flavor, texture, and aroma of wine. Today, oak treatment is one of the most important tools in the winemaking process.Aging wine in oak barrels allows for moderate oxidation and evaporation of the wine, which lowers astringency and increases complexity and concentration in the wine. The complex chemical compounds in oak wood impart flavors and aromas to the wine that include toast, vanilla, tea, and nuttiness. These are flavors that we connect with bread or baked goods, like pie crust and biscuits.  If you can imagine the difference between a spoon full of jam vs. that same jam spread over a warm slice of toast, you can imagine how oak flavors and aromas can enhance the experience of a wine.Oak sources can be as specific as coming from a particular forest, but in general, we look to French oak for silkier textures and spicier characters.  Eastern European countries such as Hungary, Croatia, and Russia offer similar varieties of oak, but each source offers different results of spice, nuttiness, texture in the wine. We look to American oak for stronger influences of vanilla and coconut with creamier textures.  Bread & Butter Chardonnay and Pinot Noir are aged in a combination of French, American, and East European oak, ranging from new to 4 years old. We also utilize multiple cooperages, typically at a medium toast level, but continue to experiment with different oak sources, treatments, and technologies. Our goal is to continually improve enjoyment while maintaining an accessible price for our customers.  Much like a spice rack, the age of the oak, the type of oak, the level of toasting, the cooper, and even the way the wood was harvested or cut has an effect on the flavors and aromas in the wine.  None of that matters though if the wine is not delicious for the price that one pays, so as with all things, balance is the objective.Bread & Butter Riesling does not see any oak.This is the BUTTER.Malolactic fermentation, or MLF, is the process by which we convert malic acid to lactic acid. The process increases stability of the wine but it also takes harsh, tart malic acid (think green apples) and converts it to softer, richer lactic acid (think cream and butter).  The determining factors in buttery character are directly related to 3 key factors: type, temperature, and timing.Type: While some grapes are more likely to have naturally higher levels of malic acid, the type of climate in which they are grown is a stronger determining factor.  Grapes grown in cooler climates tend to have considerably higher levels of malic acid, while grapes grown in warmer climates have lower levels. Through the process of MFL, the amount of lactic acid produced is about half the amount of malic acid with which it began. For instance, if you start with 4 g/l of malic acid, after 100% MFL, the wine will have roughly 2 g/l of lactic acid.  A higher level of malic acid should convert to more lactic acid, thus producing more butter flavors and aromas.Temperature:  Similarly, the temperature at which we ferment the grapes will also affect the amount of buttery character in the wine. A higher temperature will produce less buttery character, while a cold fermentation will add a lot of butter flavor and aroma.Timing: When MFL is introduced has a major bearing on it’s effects on the wine.  The introduction of MFL during the primary fermentation of a wine will decrease the buttery character.  This is because the yeast that is feeding on sugar, starts feeding on the lactic acid that is being produced, which decreasing the lactic acid levels in the finished wine.  If that same wine undergoes MFL after the primary fermentation will have a higher level of lactic acid, and thus increased buttery characters.Bread & Butter Chardonnay and Pinot Noir are examples of wines that benefited from cool climate growing regions, cold fermentations, and post-primary fermentation MLF.

 Peirano Estate Cabernet Sauvignon Lodi,United States,California,Central Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,,$11.99,"The Early YearsIn 1879, with only fifty dollars in his pocket, Giacomo Peirano, a grape farmer from Genoa, Italy, immigrated to San Francisco, CA, in the hopes of fulfilling the American dream of striking it rich with gold during the historic Gold Rush age.  Soon realizing the days of really collecting a big share were no longer in sight, he decided to take whatever he had left of his fifty dollars and moved to Lodi, CA.At the time, Lodi was the home of many mining camps. Recognizing the excess of miners, yet the lack of merchants in the region, Giacomo, who was hungry and quickly running out money, scrounged up whatever cash he had left and opened up a mercantile store where miners could get all sorts of daily supplies and necessities.  The idea turned out to be an ingenious money maker and before he knew it, Giacomo was on a boat back to Italy to reunite with his adoring wife to be, Maria.  It was on this trip that he came across an idea which, unknown to him, would become the most important family jewel for centuries to come.  Along with his smitten bride, Giacomo brought with him Italian Zinfandel vine cuttings from his familys vineyard.   Upon his return to Lodi, he purchased 300 acres of land.  He proceeded to propagate and then plant the Zinfandel vines, creating one of the first vineyards in Lodi.  The vines expanded to cover seventy-five acres of the farmland.  Tending to them like they were his children, he spent long hours in the vineyards diligently working to     help the fruit reach its optimal level of ripeness.  He hand pruned and harvested every vine with precision care.  Quickly, caring for the grapes became a family affair.  Maria watched over the mercantile business, which helped to pay for the vineyards, while Giacomo was out in the fields with his five young sons Charles, William, George, Fred, and Frank.  This was the beginning of a family tradition that would last for generations to come. Family TragedyThe Peirano family had much to be thankful for. Their mercantile business was doing well, and the vineyards had grown to be a profitable venture, but the family was soon to endure the greatest pain they had ever experienced.  At the age of ten, Fred Peirano was kicked in the head by a horse and died as a result of his injuries.  Then, as if that was not enough, Frank died of blood poisoning at the age of twenty.  Giacomo and Maria were grief stricken and struggled to keep it together for the sake of their other three children.  To cope with their grief, they threw themselves into their mercantile and farming businesses. Giacomo and his remaining three sons diligently worked in the vineyards from morning till night while Maria occupied her mind with the shop. World War IAround 1914, after many years of devotion to an industry that earned him great respect, Giacomo Peirano hung up his farming hat and retired.  He passed down the 300 acres of land along with the mercantile business to his sons, Charlie, William, and George who carried on the family traditions with great pride. George and Charlie were the most involved with the vineyards, and William oversaw the mercantile business. Soon after, Charlie was called to fight in World War I from which he received a Purple Heart after becoming injured in the line of duty.  During this time, William and George held down the fort.  ProhibitionIn 1920, the government passed a law that would last for thirteen years prohibiting the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of alcohol across the majority of the states.  This era is infamously known as Prohibition.  For many grape farmers and winemakers, this turned into a financial disaster that they were never, fully, able to recover from.  For the Peirano family, this industry disaster resulted in advantageous conditions for their farming practice.  Since they were in the business of farming Zinfandel vines, which had yet to gain attention at the congressional level as a viable source for “wine grape production, the Peirano family bootlegged the fruit of their labor in mass quantities to Italian home winemakers in New York and Canada, providing added prosperity for almost a decade.The Great DepressionThough they were able to turn the era of Prohibition into a financial gain, a nationwide epidemic soon to follow did not treat them as kindly.  The Stock Market Crash of 1929, which notoriously resulted in the Great Depression, proved to be tough times for the Peirano family who suffered through the economic downturn like millions of other hardworking people worldwide.  There were times of starvation, fears of losing their land, and mounds of uncertainty about the future.  Eventually, with great determination and the help of World War II stimulating the economy, they were able to persevere and hold on to their land, making it through the most difficult financial period in Peirano family history.World War II                                                               Around this time, Charlotte, Charles daughter met a charming, young man, Randy Randolph, during a junior high school graduation dance.  They went to Lodi High together and became high school sweethearts.  Upon graduation, he joined the Air Force and was trained on the B-17, B-24, and B-29.  During basic training, he and Charlotte married.  She traveled with him to different Air Force academies, until he was sent off to World War II.  Upon his return, they moved to Tahoe and planned to purchase a sea plane and fly mail to and from Tahoe.  Everything changed when a friend of theirs, world famous World War II pilot, Tex Rankin, crashed and died en route to Charlotte and Randy flying their demo plane.  In wake of the catastrophe, they decided it was in the best interest of the family to halt plans for the flying service.  At this time, George was becoming gravely ill.  Charlotte and Randy moved back to Lodi and helped to run the vineyards.  In 1951, George passed away and Randy began learning the ins and outs of the business from Charles.  Eventually, Randy took over with the help of Charlotte, further continuing the family lineage in the vineyard business.  They would drag around their young son Lance, present day owner of Peirano Estate Vineyards, through the vineyards and began teaching him at the age of four the art of winemaking.  By the age of six, Lance was driving tractors, setting the stage for another great Peirano to harvest great winemaking grapes.Present DayIn 1992, Lance Randolph, the fourth generation of Peirano to farm the 300 acre estate, began making Peirano wine simply for himself and to prove Lodi could produce desirable wines.  After considerable praise for his ability to make elegant wines, he decided to start bottling and selling Peirano wine using his estate grown grapes.  Since then, Peirano has won numerous awards for producing top of the line wine using many of the old techniques valued by Giacomo Peirano.The history of Peirano Estate Vineyards is a tale deeply rooted in Lodi history and the importance is felt by every member of the Peirano family.  Legend has it that Lodi was named after Giacomos famous racer horse, Alta Genoa, he brought from Lodi, Italy. Over the years, the vineyards have grown to not only include the same naturally rooted, head trained Old Vine Zinfandel imported to the United States by Lances great grandfather, but Cabernet Sauvignon, Viogner, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Muscat Canelli, Merlot, Shiraz, Tempranillo, Petite Sirah, Barbera, Syrah and  Malbec as well.  The difficult times in the Peirano family history, did prove to be challenging but showed their tenacity through desperation and hard times.  How, you might ask, were they able to persevere?  As Lance Randolph says, “A family that works together stays together, and the vineyards are a big part of our family.  Its as simple as that!",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Hidalgo Jerez Oloroso Gobernador,Spain,Jerez - Xeres - Sherry,Manzanilla Sanlucar de Barrame,Palomino,Still wine,$30.99,$24.99,"Founded in 1792 by Jose Pantaleon Hidalgo, Bodegas Hidalgo is owned by the sixth successive generation of the family. Hidalgo is a modern rarity, being the last remaining family business (and almacenista, for those familiar with this term) to produce and export its own unblended, single-solera Sherries.Just as rare is Bodegas Hidalgo’s total reliance on its own vineyards, 500 acres of Palomino Fino located in the great chalk pagos (”crus”) of Balbaina - the closest Jerez vineyard to the sea - and Miraflores, the great Sanlucar vineyard renowned for the pedigree of its wines. Just as significant is the privileged location of the family’s Bodega San Luis - at beach-level in Sanlucar de Barrameda, where the Guadalquivir River meets the ocean. Here, the miracle of Manzanilla is made possible by constant exposure to Atlantic breezes, laden with moisture and an ambient yeast/algae culture called flor. This surface-growing culture thrives year-round along Sanlucar’s southwest-facing beachfront, protecting the resting wines from exposure to the air. At the same time, flor imparts the bracing, briny smell of sea spray which is Manzanilla’s hallmark, reflecting its years-long maturation process within earshot of the waves.La Gitana Manzanilla (”the gypsy”), is Hidalgo’s flagship wine, product of a family solera established in the early 19th century, around the same time Manzanilla as a wine type came into existence. La Gitana is regarded as the authoritative Manzanilla in Spain and abroad.Pastrana Manzanilla Pasada: To the southeast of Sanlucar lies a chalk dune overlooking the Atlantic which offers the perfect conditions for ripening the Palomino grape and for production of the region’s finest dry wines. This is Miraflores, the Grand Cru of Jerez Superior. Hidalgo’s ancestral Pastrana site, a monopole holding, is at the heart of Miraflores. Pastrana contributes the length and finesse, perhaps even the soul, in all of Hidalgo’s magnificent wines, and a decision was taken some years back to market small quantities of the most exemplary manzanilla from this superlative vineyard on its own.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

Each variety is vinified separately.On the first day of fermentation, the wine undergoes a slight draining of 10-20%, so as to obtain half a litre of wine from each kg of grapes, increasing its concentration.Maceration on the skins continues for 22 days in stainless-steel tanks at a controlled temperature of 28°C.Alcoholic fermentation lasts 10 days on average.Immediately after racking, the wine is placed in new Allier oak barrels.

 Charles Smith Chateau Smith Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$21.19,$16.99,"Growing up just outside of Sacramento, California, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Charles Smith began craving worldly travel at a young age due to his Welsh mother and French father. As soon as he had the chance, Charles decided to move to Denmark (for a “hot piece of a** i.e. a lady friend he met in the states). While in Scandinavia, Charles spent the next nine years managing rock bands and concert tours throughout Europe, including the famed Danish duo, The Ravonettes. Wining and dining while on the road became a catalyst for his passion of wine, which ultimately triggered the career he has today.In 1999, he moved back to the United States, specifically to the Pacific Northwest, opening a wine shop on Bainbridge Island, just across the Puget Sound from downtown Seattle. On a road trip in late 1999, he passed through the small town of Walla Walla and met a young Frenchman and winemaker. The two men discovered their common passion for great Syrah and Charles was eventually convinced to move to Walla Walla and make his own juice. In 2001, Charles released 330 cases of his first wine, the 1999 K Syrah. The Walla Walla Valley was now his home.After a devastating freeze in 2004, Charles brought to life a label he had once in a dream: House Wine. Low and behold, the label concept had never been created or trademarked, so Charles launched the legendary brand before selling it to Precept Brands in 2006. That same year, Charles started a second brand, Charles Smith Wines. The brand was themed as “The Modernist Project, which focuses on the way people generally consume wine today: immediately. The intent was (and still is) to create wines to be enjoyed now, but with true typicity of both the varietal and the vineyard.A self-taught winemaker, Charles is a true artisan and a pioneer in the wine world. In 2008, K Vintners was recognized by Wine & Spirits magazine as one of the “Best New Wineries of the Last Ten Years, and as “Winery of the Year in their annual buying guide.

Great attention has been given to the bottle study giving distinctiveness and authority to the product; finally the use of Santero logo in relief increases value and quality to the whole product. Labels by particular shape and shading colours with attention both to every detail and to all particulars, both to the shadings and to the reflexions, give a touch of elegance to the whole bottle.Large areas grown with mono grape wine and a rich endowment of historical wine cellars dug into the tufa, of ancient farmhouse by elegant architectures, of medieval villages enhanced by churches and castles of a secular culture based on the wine production.

 Folie A Deux Sonoma Country Pinot Noir,United States,California,Sonoma County,Pinot Noir,Still wine,,$19.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the world’s leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Mario’s son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Home’s original philosophy to offer ”a great product for a fair price,” even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Ironside Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,N/A,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,,$14.99,"WE’LL ADMIT IT, WE LOVE GREAT WINE…That’s why we started Ninety+ Cellars.It all started in the spring of 2009. Armed with a copy of the latest Wine Spectator, founder Kevin Mehra set out on a mission to bring higher quality wine to the market for a better price. He started calling wineries with a history of high ratings to ask if they had extra wine for sale. Some told him to get lost, but in the end, he found a handful of wineries that liked his concept. The plan was simple: we put their wine in our bottle, and sell it for less.But why would wineries want to do that?You may recall that the economy wasn’t in the best shape in 2009. Demand for wines priced more than $20 a bottle had plummeted and inventories were piling up. Rather than discount their wine and erode the value of their brand, we found that wineries were willing to part with a certain percentage of their production for a reduced price.It was a win/win scenario. Wineries got to sell more wine, and consumers got access to better wine at lower prices.The landscape has changed quite a bit since we launched; but our mission and our ability to offer great wine has not. With our head wine buyer, Brett Vankoski, at the helm we continue to seek out the best opportunities in the market and turn those into great values in the bottle for you.

 Bodega Noemia de Patagonia A Lisa Malbec,Argentina,Southern Region,Rio Negro,Malbec,Still wine,,$16.99,"The Bodega Noemia de Patagonia project began with the discovery and restoration of an ancient vineyard, hidden among a cluster of poplars surrounding this small vineyard. This old vineyard was planted with Malbec grapes in the 1930s in a remote corner of the Rio Negro valley. It was quite a feat to reach such a hidden place; 620 miles south of Buenos Aires, 280 miles to the east of the Andes, 310 miles west of the Atlantic coast or 1240 miles from Tierra del Fuego.The project partners, famous Italian wine producer Countess Noemi Marone Cinzano and Danish winemaker Hans Vinding-Diers, fell in love with the place and decided to restore it and return it to its original condition.After buying the grapes from this semi-abandoned vineyard in 2001, their first vintage was made in an old shed belonging to a fruit packing company; they destemmed the grapes by hand at night, and put them in open fibreglass tanks so that they could crush them with their feet. The idea was to get back to basics.In 2004, Noemi and Hans decided to buy that same vineyard and have continued the project to this day with the same passion with which they started it.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"
 e Guigal Saint-Joseph Blanc,France,Rhone,Northern Rhone,White Rhone Blend,Still wine,$32.59,$24.99,"Not many wine lovers realize just how important white wines are at Guigal, where 25% of total production is in white. By contrast only 2% of total production in the Rhone valley is white wines. Perhaps even more impressive, this family-owned and -operated domain is responsible for almost a third of the total production of Condrieu. And a reliably excellent Condrieu it is, as is the high-end La Doriane bottling, which in many vintages is one the very best bottlings made from the appellation. Philippe Guigal admits that he has a bit of an obsession with white Hermitage and he’s especially fussy about the luxe Ex-Voto bottling, a wine that he only bottles in exceptional vintages like 2015. The 2013 version, by the way, is still painfully young, but based on the bottle I drank last month it’s a genuine cellar treasure and, in the context of world-class white wines, a relative bargain that should easily reach its 30th birthday if well cellared.From 2016 Northern Rhone Whites: Excellent but Often Scarce (May 2018) by Josh Raynolds",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Airfield Estates Runway Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,,$16.99,"As the name suggests, our family estate has historical ties to aviation! To find out more about the WWII airbase that resided on our property, see the sections below:The official story:Just prior to the United States entry into World War II, the Olympic Air Transport Company contacted our founder, H. Lloyd Miller, about the possibility of leasing land from him for a period of a few years in order to build an airbase to train military pilots. Lloyd, a successful realtor and landowner, knew it would be several years before the arrival of Roza irrigation water so he agreed to lease out his property.Construction of the airbase commenced in the latter part of 1941. The buildings erected on the site included a 70 foot water tower, several airplane hangars, a mess hall, barracks, and several smaller storage buildings. Three dirt runways were also formed, each of which was over a half mile long. The pilots trained primarily on bi-winged Stearman Airplanes.The airbase continued operations until the mid 1940’s. Shortly after WWII came to an end, the pilots moved off site and the recently constructed buildings were auctioned off to the highest bidder. The only bidder turned out to be H. Lloyd Miller, and it is said that he got one heck of a deal on all the buildings. These unique buildings became the headquarters of the Miller family’s farming operations up to today. Over time, many of the buildings began to deteriorate, but two of the original hangars still exist and we continue to use them as workshop and storage facilities.The rumors: The unofficial story is that the military airbase had ulterior motives. It was not just designed for training pilots. During the war years, there were six small airbases that made a horseshoe pattern around Hanford Reach. These bases were located near Moxee, Ephrata, Connell, Othello, Richland, and “Airfield’s” base in Sunnyside. These bases were strategically located around Hanford Reach in order to conduct surveillance over the highly classified Hanford Nuclear Reservation that was refining plutonium for the atomic bombs that would eventually be dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. The airbase also provided potential defense if we came under attack because the runways were long enough to allow for the landing of larger fighter and attack aircrafts. Although these are just rumors, they do make a lot of sense.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

Founded in 1972 by David S. Stare, Dry Creek Vineyard paved the way for a renaissance of winemaking and viticulture in the Dry Creek Valley. Before his arrival, the Dry Creek Valley was little more than a few family farms and prune orchards. It was Dave’s vision to start a Loire Valley inspired winery, which triggered a viticultural reawakening in northern Sonoma County.Without a doubt, David Stare is a pioneer. Heading west in the late 1960s, he personified the character and work ethic of early Gold Rush pioneers. Educated at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Dave worked for the B&O Railroad for several years but quickly realized that his true calling was in the wine industry. Inspired by his trips to the Loire Valley, he headed west to California to start his own family winery.Upon his arrival, Dave began taking winemaking classes at UC Davis as a graduate student. On the weekends, he spent time looking at vineyard land from Monterey to Mendocino. It was during one of those weekend trips that fate drew Dave to the Dry Creek Valley. When he saw an old prune orchard across the street from the Dry Creek General Store, Dave realized that he had found his dream location. He purchased the orchard and began planting vines. Captivated by his memories of Loire-style wines, Sauvignon Blanc seemed destined to figure prominently in the Dry Creek Vineyard portfolio. However, several famed vineyard specialists advised him against planting Sauvignon Blanc. Always looking to push the envelope, Dave planted the varietal anyway and the rest is history.Today, our second-generation family owned winery continues to evolve and grow to meet the demands of a global wine marketplace. The primary mission of our winery is to produce distinctive wines that overdeliver on quality. For more than 40 years, this pursuit of winemaking excellence has led to many international awards and accolades. With a loyal following of wine club members and customers, the future of Dry Creek Vineyard has never been brighter.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

" Peirano White "" The Other """,United States,California,Central Valley,Non-Varietal White Blend,Still wine,$-0.01,$6.98,"The Early YearsIn 1879, with only fifty dollars in his pocket, Giacomo Peirano, a grape farmer from Genoa, Italy, immigrated to San Francisco, CA, in the hopes of fulfilling the American dream of striking it rich with gold during the historic Gold Rush age.  Soon realizing the days of really collecting a big share were no longer in sight, he decided to take whatever he had left of his fifty dollars and moved to Lodi, CA.At the time, Lodi was the home of many mining camps. Recognizing the excess of miners, yet the lack of merchants in the region, Giacomo, who was hungry and quickly running out money, scrounged up whatever cash he had left and opened up a mercantile store where miners could get all sorts of daily supplies and necessities.  The idea turned out to be an ingenious money maker and before he knew it, Giacomo was on a boat back to Italy to reunite with his adoring wife to be, Maria.  It was on this trip that he came across an idea which, unknown to him, would become the most important family jewel for centuries to come.  Along with his smitten bride, Giacomo brought with him Italian Zinfandel vine cuttings from his familys vineyard.   Upon his return to Lodi, he purchased 300 acres of land.  He proceeded to propagate and then plant the Zinfandel vines, creating one of the first vineyards in Lodi.  The vines expanded to cover seventy-five acres of the farmland.  Tending to them like they were his children, he spent long hours in the vineyards diligently working to     help the fruit reach its optimal level of ripeness.  He hand pruned and harvested every vine with precision care.  Quickly, caring for the grapes became a family affair.  Maria watched over the mercantile business, which helped to pay for the vineyards, while Giacomo was out in the fields with his five young sons Charles, William, George, Fred, and Frank.  This was the beginning of a family tradition that would last for generations to come. Family TragedyThe Peirano family had much to be thankful for. Their mercantile business was doing well, and the vineyards had grown to be a profitable venture, but the family was soon to endure the greatest pain they had ever experienced.  At the age of ten, Fred Peirano was kicked in the head by a horse and died as a result of his injuries.  Then, as if that was not enough, Frank died of blood poisoning at the age of twenty.  Giacomo and Maria were grief stricken and struggled to keep it together for the sake of their other three children.  To cope with their grief, they threw themselves into their mercantile and farming businesses. Giacomo and his remaining three sons diligently worked in the vineyards from morning till night while Maria occupied her mind with the shop. World War IAround 1914, after many years of devotion to an industry that earned him great respect, Giacomo Peirano hung up his farming hat and retired.  He passed down the 300 acres of land along with the mercantile business to his sons, Charlie, William, and George who carried on the family traditions with great pride. George and Charlie were the most involved with the vineyards, and William oversaw the mercantile business. Soon after, Charlie was called to fight in World War I from which he received a Purple Heart after becoming injured in the line of duty.  During this time, William and George held down the fort.  ProhibitionIn 1920, the government passed a law that would last for thirteen years prohibiting the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of alcohol across the majority of the states.  This era is infamously known as Prohibition.  For many grape farmers and winemakers, this turned into a financial disaster that they were never, fully, able to recover from.  For the Peirano family, this industry disaster resulted in advantageous conditions for their farming practice.  Since they were in the business of farming Zinfandel vines, which had yet to gain attention at the congressional level as a viable source for “wine grape production, the Peirano family bootlegged the fruit of their labor in mass quantities to Italian home winemakers in New York and Canada, providing added prosperity for almost a decade.The Great DepressionThough they were able to turn the era of Prohibition into a financial gain, a nationwide epidemic soon to follow did not treat them as kindly.  The Stock Market Crash of 1929, which notoriously resulted in the Great Depression, proved to be tough times for the Peirano family who suffered through the economic downturn like millions of other hardworking people worldwide.  There were times of starvation, fears of losing their land, and mounds of uncertainty about the future.  Eventually, with great determination and the help of World War II stimulating the economy, they were able to persevere and hold on to their land, making it through the most difficult financial period in Peirano family history.World War II                                                               Around this time, Charlotte, Charles daughter met a charming, young man, Randy Randolph, during a junior high school graduation dance.  They went to Lodi High together and became high school sweethearts.  Upon graduation, he joined the Air Force and was trained on the B-17, B-24, and B-29.  During basic training, he and Charlotte married.  She traveled with him to different Air Force academies, until he was sent off to World War II.  Upon his return, they moved to Tahoe and planned to purchase a sea plane and fly mail to and from Tahoe.  Everything changed when a friend of theirs, world famous World War II pilot, Tex Rankin, crashed and died en route to Charlotte and Randy flying their demo plane.  In wake of the catastrophe, they decided it was in the best interest of the family to halt plans for the flying service.  At this time, George was becoming gravely ill.  Charlotte and Randy moved back to Lodi and helped to run the vineyards.  In 1951, George passed away and Randy began learning the ins and outs of the business from Charles.  Eventually, Randy took over with the help of Charlotte, further continuing the family lineage in the vineyard business.  They would drag around their young son Lance, present day owner of Peirano Estate Vineyards, through the vineyards and began teaching him at the age of four the art of winemaking.  By the age of six, Lance was driving tractors, setting the stage for another great Peirano to harvest great winemaking grapes.Present DayIn 1992, Lance Randolph, the fourth generation of Peirano to farm the 300 acre estate, began making Peirano wine simply for himself and to prove Lodi could produce desirable wines.  After considerable praise for his ability to make elegant wines, he decided to start bottling and selling Peirano wine using his estate grown grapes.  Since then, Peirano has won numerous awards for producing top of the line wine using many of the old techniques valued by Giacomo Peirano.The history of Peirano Estate Vineyards is a tale deeply rooted in Lodi history and the importance is felt by every member of the Peirano family.  Legend has it that Lodi was named after Giacomos famous racer horse, Alta Genoa, he brought from Lodi, Italy. Over the years, the vineyards have grown to not only include the same naturally rooted, head trained Old Vine Zinfandel imported to the United States by Lances great grandfather, but Cabernet Sauvignon, Viogner, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Muscat Canelli, Merlot, Shiraz, Tempranillo, Petite Sirah, Barbera, Syrah and  Malbec as well.  The difficult times in the Peirano family history, did prove to be challenging but showed their tenacity through desperation and hard times.  How, you might ask, were they able to persevere?  As Lance Randolph says, “A family that works together stays together, and the vineyards are a big part of our family.  Its as simple as that!",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

In 1880, Andrea I sold the small vineyards in the island and bought 150 acres of virgin land in the north of Tunisia - precisely at Khanguet Gare, in the region of Cape Bon. There were planted and picked the first grapes then, in the early years of the XXth century, Andrea I and his son Giovanni began to produce quality wines in their family cellar. Such a good wine that from the port of Tunis departed full-loaded cargos to serve the best markets of France.In 1938 Andrea II, son of Giovanni, was only sixteen when he took the business in his hands and continued to rise the fame and quality of the wines with courage and toil. But a terrible illness striked Tunisia destroying all the vineyards: Filossera. The dry grapes were burned and the obtained coal was sold in the market of Tunis.The family got new plants of innested barbatelle resisting to the disease from France and the red and desolate lands began to colour up again with green leaves and generous grapes.On May 12th, in 1964, Habib Bourguiba - the current president of Tunisia at that time - with an historically important measure dispossessed all the goods and properties of the foreigners in Tunisia.Suddently a life-time hard work and sacrifice was wiped out and the Pandolfo family had to leave the country and divide between Italy and France. Andrea II at that time was fourty-two years old and, with his wife Elena and his sons, decided to come back to Italy to buy a small estate close to Terracina in Via Renibbio n° 1720 where he re-started to till that bitter-sweet land and to harvest, during the vintage of 1968, the first grapes to make wine.With the first customers, the first bottles with hand-written labels and the first chestnut barrels the family cellar started to set up in the early wine-producing realities of the Pontina region. In 1976 Andrea II Pandolfo died and his sons, sided by the help of their mother Elena, decided to carry on that dream which began 150 years before by Andrea I in Pantelleria island.This is how the farm ’Sant’Andrea’ was born, also to remember the name of its founder.

 Sutter Home  Sangria,United States,California,N/A,Non-Varietal Red Blend,Still wine,,$6.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the world’s leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Mario’s son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Home’s original philosophy to offer ”a great product for a fair price,” even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the world’s leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Mario’s son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Home’s original philosophy to offer ”a great product for a fair price,” even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites.

Others think it’s all about the convenience of the ring, the simple loop that makes it easy to carry, pour and share your favorite wine.

Dating back to 1839, the Domaine consists of 23 hectares across the communes of Les Maranges, Santenay, Puligny and Chassange Montrachet, Meursault, Volnay and Pommard.The family winery is located in the village of Santenay-la-Bas, and Roger holds the single largest parcel of Grand Cru Criots Batard Montrachet. The philosophy of the Domaine is to work early and intensively in the vineyard. Using no pesticides for over 20 years, the family ploughs the soil to control the weeds, while encouraging the roots to dig deeper.Shoots are thinned before bud-break for a naturally low yield that prevents the need for green harvesting, and leaves are thinned several times to attain good aeration and sunlight for the clusters. Grass is encouraged to grow between the rows to stimulate microbial activity that drastically limits the need for treatment of the vines. The result is maximum expression of ”terroir”.With only perfectly ripe bunches, hand-cut from the vine, vinification takes place in a modern winery and ageing occurs in only the best oak barrels that are up to three years old. Employing a traditional winemaking process, all of Roger and Julie’s wines are spectacular and rare.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

The selection set out to produce a wine that could measure itself against the more structured Piedmontese reds, and deal confidently with decidedly long periods of ageing without forfeiting the elegance that is typical of the Nebbiolos originating on the steep slopes of the Roero. Here, on the limy, east-facing soil of Frailin hill, the grapes can benefit from dry, hot summer days, as well as enjoying the last lingering lukewarm rays of the setting sun in autumn: something which is often forgotten as being essential for a late-ripening variety such as Nebbiolo. Grown following traditional local mthods, the grapes are picked in the middle of October. The fermentation is always long and slow so as to allow all the natural ingredients contained in the grapes to develop in the wine. It is then drawn off into different fill barrels, where it completes its malolactic fermentation and remains for at least 24 months. After a further year of maturing in the peace and quiet of our old cellars, the wine is bottled in preparation for its release. With its expansive, fruity nose, followed by length and body on the mouth, though the taste is dominated by the elegance of Roero tannins, it will continue to improve with lengthy aging in the bottle.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Sycamore Lane White Zinfandel,United States,California,N/A,Zinfandel,Still wine,$5.59,$4.69,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the world’s leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Mario’s son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his family’s efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a ”stuck” fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Home’s original philosophy to offer ”a great product for a fair price,” even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Joseph Drouhin Puligny Montrachet,France,Burgundy,Cote de Beaune,Chardonnay,Still wine,,$64.99,"Winemaker Jerome Faure-Brac wasn’t wild for the sun-drenched 2015s at the beginning owing to their deficit of acidity (none of the finished wines have as much as 4 grams per liter). But the wines didn’t change much during the secondary fermentations due to the lack of malic acidity. The lees were also very clean so Faure-Brac kept as much of them as possible, which he believes contributed to the ultimate freshness of the wines. They finished tactile and saline, with some evidence of tannins. “It’s rare that we have such a combination of richness and tension,” said Faure-Brac, “and of course it’s an amazing vintage for the reds.”",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 90+ Cellars Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon Lot 94,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,,$24.99,"WE’LL ADMIT IT, WE LOVE GREAT WINE…That’s why we started Ninety+ Cellars.It all started in the spring of 2009. Armed with a copy of the latest Wine Spectator, founder Kevin Mehra set out on a mission to bring higher quality wine to the market for a better price. He started calling wineries with a history of high ratings to ask if they had extra wine for sale. Some told him to get lost, but in the end, he found a handful of wineries that liked his concept. The plan was simple: we put their wine in our bottle, and sell it for less.But why would wineries want to do that?You may recall that the economy wasn’t in the best shape in 2009. Demand for wines priced more than $20 a bottle had plummeted and inventories were piling up. Rather than discount their wine and erode the value of their brand, we found that wineries were willing to part with a certain percentage of their production for a reduced price.It was a win/win scenario. Wineries got to sell more wine, and consumers got access to better wine at lower prices.The landscape has changed quite a bit since we launched; but our mission and our ability to offer great wine has not. With our head wine buyer, Brett Vankoski, at the helm we continue to seek out the best opportunities in the market and turn those into great values in the bottle for you. We do this because we love great wine, and we know you do too.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

In 1975 Italian wine maker Francesco Paschina stepped down from the traditional winemaking process. Francesco wanted to do something different, turn traditional wine into a groundbreaking new product. With Luigi Bosca, wine magician Francesco worked out his idea in Canelli in Piemonte, Italy. An area where many muscat grapes are grown, for instance for the Asti Spumante. There arose the idea of creating an accessible wine that would be so fresh and bubbly, that people from all over the world would love. He took the muscat grape as a base and added natural aroma’s and a light bubble. The result: a Frizzante wine with a low alcohol percentage, a subtle bubble and a delicate sweet taste.
