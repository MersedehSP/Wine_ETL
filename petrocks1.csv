3, Colosi Nero d' Avola,Italy,Sicily,Sicilia,Nero d'Avola,Still wine,,$12.99,"
The Colosi family has been making wine on the beautiful island of Salina (part of the Aeolian Islands off the northern tip of Sicily) since 1987.

You get a lot of authenticity and personality with these wines. -Monica Larner, WA (8/17)

5, William Hill Chardonnay North Coast,United States,California,North Coast,Chardonnay,Still wine,$17.99,$12.99,"
William Hill Estate Winery is a special place. In 1978, visionary vineyard developer William Hill saw the incredible potential of the Silverado Bench, where he built his namesake winery. More than three decades later, our winemaker Ralf Holdenried is making modern wines that speak to the unique terroir of this virtually unknown area of southern Napa Valley.
A confluence of characteristics makes our 140-acre estate an ideal vineyard. Set on a benchland - off the valley floor, but below the steeper slopes of the hills - with a southwestern exposure, the vines bask in abundant sunlight. The vineyard is close to the valley floor climatically, but the volcanic soil and the size and vigor of the vines means William Hill is more like a mountaintop vineyard. These elements translate to elegant, expressive red Bordeaux wines.

To preserve and enhance the snappy, clean fruit flavors and acidity, winemakers carefully craft our Pinot Grigio in a reductive style, protecting the juice from oxygen exposure. We avoid malolactic fermentation, and instead ferment the grapes in stainless steel tanks at cold temperatures to retain the grapes’ natural flavors and delicate aromas. We bottle the wine early, when the fruit flavors and aromas are at their best, and use a Stelcap closure to ensure that every glass is always fresh and delicious.

the series: appellation series
At La Crema, we arerather passionate about terroir. Especially when it comes to Pinot Noir. The In general, terroir conveys the unique characteristics of a site – everything from soil, wind and temperature to the neighboring eucalyptus trees or distance from the sea. For Pinot Noir in particular, it means the subtle expressiveness and texture of one site literally cannot be duplicated elsewhere. Produced in limited quantities, our Appellation Pinot Noirs are rooted in this concept: four exceptional cool-climate growing areas offering clearly
different expressions of this alluring varietal.
the place: russian river valley
Pinot Noir’s temperamental and fragile nature makes it a challenge from vine to bottle. Russian River Valley offers the ideal climate for Pinot to reveal its brilliance. Cool coastal fog rolls over the vineyards each evening and the fruit ripens at a leisurely pace in the moderate climate. Concentrated, small berries literally burst with flavor, wrapped up in heady spice and plush, round texture. For this release, our winemaker focuses on creating a complex, layered blend that marries the particular flavors, aromas, and structural characteristics of different vineyard sites within the appellation.

Exclusively initiated from our own Freixenet cultures, the first fermentation is introduced into the tanks. After 10 to 12 days, the wine is racked and clarified as the blend is readied for bottling. The secondary fermentation finds the bottles of Cordon Negro cradled in the perfectly chilled caves for up to 18 months

THE SERIES: SONOMA COAST
Since 1979, La Crema has crafted the traditional wine varietals of Burgundy in the cool vineyards of the Sonoma Coast. This coastal region’s boundary begins at the Mendocino County border, continues along the western coastal edge of Sonoma County through the mouth of the Russian River Valley; and extends to the Los Carneros region on the southern Sonoma/Napa border. Our Sonoma Coast wines are a tribute to the tremendously fresh, concentrated and layered palette of flavors offered
by these coastal vineyards. Crafted one barrel at a time at our family-owned winery, Sonoma Coast wines offer exceptional balance and fruit intensity.
THE PLACE: SONOMA COAST
Like the Burgundy wine region of France, the vineyards of the Sonoma Coast offer an unusually long, cool and steady growing season. Lingering fog and wind from the nearby Pacific Ocean moderate temperatures throughout the season and slow the ripening process. With an extended “hang” time on the vines, the results at harvest are small berries with firm acidity and highly concentrated varietal aromas and flavors.

Robert Mondavi established his namesake winery in 1966 with a vision to create Napa Valley wines that would stand in the company of the world’s finest. He chose To Kalon Vineyard in the heart of the Napa Valley as the home for Robert Mondavi Winery.

Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir.

Co-founded by Dan and Margaret Duckhorn in 1976, Duckhorn Vineyards has spent more than 30 years establishing itself as one of North America’s premier producers of Bordeaux varietal wines. From its modest inaugural vintage of 800 cases of Cabernet Sauvignon and 800 cases of Merlot in 1978, to its addition of Sauvignon Blanc in 1982, Duckhorn Vineyards has crafted a tradition of quality and excellence that continues today.

96, Chateau Lamartine Cahors Prestige du Malbec,France,South West France,Cahors,Malbec,Still wine,,$15.99,"
Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

104, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

107, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir.

176, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

179, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

Co-founded by Dan and Margaret Duckhorn in 1976, Duckhorn Vineyards has spent more than 30 years establishing itself as one of North America’s premier producers of Bordeaux varietal wines. From its modest inaugural vintage of 800 cases of Cabernet Sauvignon and 800 cases of Merlot in 1978, to its addition of Sauvignon Blanc in 1982, Duckhorn Vineyards has crafted a tradition of quality and excellence that continues today.

258, Chateau Lamartine Cahors Prestige du Malbec,France,South West France,Cahors,Malbec,Still wine,,$15.99,"
Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

266, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

269, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

341, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County.

We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.

Co-founded by Dan and Margaret Duckhorn in 1976, Duckhorn Vineyards has spent more than 30 years establishing itself as one of North America’s premier producers of Bordeaux varietal wines.

420, Chateau Lamartine Cahors Prestige du Malbec,France,South West France,Cahors,Malbec,Still wine,,$15.99,"
Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

428, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

431, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

Co-founded by Dan and Margaret Duckhorn in 1976, Duckhorn Vineyards has spent more than 30 years establishing itself as one of North America’s premier producers of Bordeaux varietal wines.

Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

518, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

590, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

593, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

Co-founded by Dan and Margaret Duckhorn in 1976, Duckhorn Vineyards has spent more than 30 years establishing itself as one of North America’s premier producers of Bordeaux varietal wines. From its modest inaugural vintage of 800 cases of Cabernet Sauvignon and 800 cases of Merlot in 1978, to its addition of Sauvignon Blanc in 1982, Duckhorn Vineyards has crafted a tradition of quality and excellence that continues today.

672, Chateau Lamartine Cahors Prestige du Malbec,France,South West France,Cahors,Malbec,Still wine,,$15.99,"
Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

680, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

683, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.

752, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

755, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

762, Chateau Lamartine Cahors Prestige du Malbec,France,South West France,Cahors,Malbec,Still wine,,$15.99,"
Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

Co-founded by Dan and Margaret Duckhorn in 1976, Duckhorn Vineyards has spent more than 30 years establishing itself as one of North America’s premier producers of Bordeaux varietal wines. From its modest inaugural vintage of 800 cases of Cabernet Sauvignon and 800 cases of Merlot in 1978, to its addition of Sauvignon Blanc in 1982, Duckhorn Vineyards has crafted a tradition of quality and excellence that continues today.

834, Chateau Lamartine Cahors Prestige du Malbec,France,South West France,Cahors,Malbec,Still wine,,$15.99,"
Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

842, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

845, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

917, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

Co-founded by Dan and Margaret Duckhorn in 1976, Duckhorn Vineyards has spent more than 30 years establishing itself as one of North America’s premier producers of Bordeaux varietal wines. From its modest inaugural vintage of 800 cases of Cabernet Sauvignon and 800 cases of Merlot in 1978, to its addition of Sauvignon Blanc in 1982, Duckhorn Vineyards has crafted a tradition of quality and excellence that continues today.

996, Chateau Lamartine Cahors Prestige du Malbec,France,South West France,Cahors,Malbec,Still wine,,$15.99,"
Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

1004, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

1007, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

1079, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

1094, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

From its modest inaugural vintage of 800 cases of Cabernet Sauvignon and 800 cases of Merlot in 1978, to its addition of Sauvignon Blanc in 1982, Duckhorn Vineyards has crafted a tradition of quality and excellence that continues today.

1158, Chateau Lamartine Cahors Prestige du Malbec,France,South West France,Cahors,Malbec,Still wine,,$15.99,"
Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

1166, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

1169, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

1241, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

Co-founded by Dan and Margaret Duckhorn in 1976, Duckhorn Vineyards has spent more than 30 years establishing itself as one of North America’s premier producers of Bordeaux varietal wines.

1248, Chateau Lamartine Cahors Prestige du Malbec,France,South West France,Cahors,Malbec,Still wine,,$15.99,"
Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

1256, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

1320, Chateau Lamartine Cahors Prestige du Malbec,France,South West France,Cahors,Malbec,Still wine,,$15.99,"
Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

1328, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

1331, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

Co-founded by Dan and Margaret Duckhorn in 1976, Duckhorn Vineyards has spent more than 30 years establishing itself as one of North America’s premier producers of Bordeaux varietal wines.

Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

1418, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

1490, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

1493, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

Co-founded by Dan and Margaret Duckhorn in 1976, Duckhorn Vineyards has spent more than 30 years establishing itself as one of North America’s premier producers of Bordeaux varietal wines. From its modest inaugural vintage of 800 cases of Cabernet Sauvignon and 800 cases of Merlot in 1978, to its addition of Sauvignon Blanc in 1982, Duckhorn Vineyards has crafted a tradition of quality and excellence that continues today.

Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

1652, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

1655, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price.

Co-founded by Dan and Margaret Duckhorn in 1976, Duckhorn Vineyards has spent more than 30 years establishing itself as one of North America’s premier producers of Bordeaux varietal wines. From its modest inaugural vintage of 800 cases of Cabernet Sauvignon and 800 cases of Merlot in 1978, to its addition of Sauvignon Blanc in 1982, Duckhorn Vineyards has crafted a tradition of quality and excellence that continues today.

1734, Chateau Lamartine Cahors Prestige du Malbec,France,South West France,Cahors,Malbec,Still wine,,$15.99,"
Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

1742, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.

At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

1814, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

1817, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.

Co-founded by Dan and Margaret Duckhorn in 1976, Duckhorn Vineyards has spent more than 30 years establishing itself as one of North America’s premier producers of Bordeaux varietal wines. From its modest inaugural vintage of 800 cases of Cabernet Sauvignon and 800 cases of Merlot in 1978, to its addition of Sauvignon Blanc in 1982, Duckhorn Vineyards has crafted a tradition of quality and excellence that continues today.

1896, Chateau Lamartine Cahors Prestige du Malbec,France,South West France,Cahors,Malbec,Still wine,,$15.99,"
Born in the Chateau itself, the current winemaker/owner, Alain Gayraud, took over from his grandparents in 1975. Encompassing 28 hectares of vines that range in age from 20 to 120 years old, the Domaine is in the westernmost reaches of the Cahor appellation, making Chateau Lamartine the only Cahors domaine that benefits from the influence of the Atlantic. Here, the vineyards occupy the best micro-climate along the Lot River, all with southern exposure on the oldest terraces in the appellation, where the soil consists of a limestone base with a plethora of stones.
At Chateau Lamartine, Gayraud farms lutte raisonnee and spends 2,000 hours per vintage green harvesting, to attain the naturally low yields he seeks. The roots express great depth, so the vines are rarely over stressed, yielding balanced wines, even in the hottest of years.

In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

1907, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir.

1976, Buena Vista Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$44.99,$34.99,"
In the 1860’s Buena Vista covered more than 6,000 acres that ran up into the foothills and into Napa County. In 1861, our founder, Count Haraszthy, journeyed to Europe to procure the finest grapevines. While in Bordeaux, he declared “Cabernet Sauvignon is its unsurpassed grape; the wine made of it possesses splendid color and an exquisite bouquet.’ Bringing choice cuttings back to California, he propagated them at Buena Vista and bringing Cabernet Sauvignon to the Napa Valley. We celebrate Buena Vista’s historic contribution to Napa wine by offering this rich, dense and opulent Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
The inaugural release of the Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon celebrates and honors Buena Vista’s indelible presence and significant contributions to the California wine world. Buena Vista has returned to Napa Valley, where Cabernet is the King, if not the Count. Sourced from vineyards from Yountville to St. Helena, the wine was aged for 28 months before being racked and aged an additional four months in French oak barrels, 40% new, for final aging. It was then bottled unfiltered.
The wine hails from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley, and is a rich and opulent Napa red wine with intensity, structure and power. It opens with rich aromas of black cherry and cardamom with a touch of black licorice. Spreading across the palate are flavors of red plum, black currant and cherry. The fine-grained tannins are silky and soft with a full-bodied mouthfeel and a long, lingering finish.

1979, 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Washington,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Still wine,$15.19,$10.99,"
The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a “hand” being equivalent to a man’s palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.
This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.
14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience – fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price. Bringing this bottle of wine to the party is more than bringing just a wine – it’s a delicious wine with a unique story that’s sure to spark up a memorable conversation.
