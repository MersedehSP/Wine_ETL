Wheatridge Cellars seeks to bring these places together in one bottle through aging in bourbon barrels.

VINEYARD INFO/REGION
For this wine, we source grapes from California’s best growing regions. The climate is generally Mediterranean, though regions closer to the Pacific Ocean benefit from cool breezes. The 2017 vintage brought a close to the multiyear drought—filling reservoirs and bringing new life to cover crops, and then to the vines. Lots are selected to blend the characteristics from these varied regions.

WINEMAKING/VITICULTURE
From all across California, our winemaking team hand selects several grape varieties to use in our premium Red Blend. A portion of this wine then goes into used bourbon barrels, which impart the warm, caramel and coffee flavors of fine bourbon. Final blending helps to integrate both flavor profiles, creating a complex, multilayered wine.

TASTING NOTES
For this wine, traditional aromas of both premium red wine and bourbon mingle in the glass - black cherry, raspberry, molasses, and charred vanilla invite you in for a sip. On the palate, rich notes of black cherry and blackberry layer over brown sugar, coffee, and caramel.

Across the Paso region, vintners rejoiced over the success of the growing season. A wet winter fed the reservoirs and enabled healthy cover crops to regenerate the soils. Even temperatures allowed for the desired ripening of Cabernet grapes with a slightly earlier than average harvest.

Rougeot Bourgogne Blanc Grandes Gouttes,France,Burgundy,na,Chardonnay,27.99,"Organic.  100% Chardonnay.  The lieu-dit “Les Grandes Gouttes” sits at the southern edge of Meursault on border with Pugligny, just a few hundred meters below the Premier Cru vineyard Les Charmes.  The vineyard is only a hectare size and the vines were planted between 1950 – 1980 on clay-limestone soils.  Hand-harvested, direct pressing in whole bunches untrimmed, and cold settling for 2 days.  Alcoholic fermentation with natural yeasts begins in a concrete vat and then pumped into French oak barrels to undergo malolactic fermentation (5% new oak).  Aging in oak barrels for 12 months.   

""In the center of Meursault village, Pierre-Henri Rougeot has been quietly producing impeccable minimal intervention, low-sulfur wines since he returned to the family domaine in 2010. The 18th century stone cellar was originally built for the Hospices de Beaune to press the fruit from the adjacent orchards, and was purchased Pierre-Henri’s great-great-grandfather in the 19th century. Today the orchards have been transformed into an elegant garden and stamp-sized monopole vineyard, and the cellar has been renovated to comfortably hold two vintages from Rougeot’s 13 hectares of vines in and around Meursault.

Pierre-Henri’s experience travelling throughout France gives him a unique vision that hews strongly to Burgundian tradition with a soft touch inspired by the vins natures made by his friends in Saumur, Cahors, and beyond. Today, the Rougeot vineyards are farmed organically, and Pierre-Henri’s no sulfur vinification effortlessly balances a natural wine approach with traditional Burgundian technique to create wines with energy and balance. Each terroir from Aligoté and Passetoutgrain through Premier Crus is bottled as a single-vineyard designate. The wines are energetic, precise, and delicious. It’s simply astounding that the domaine has maintained a quiet profile while producing such compelling wines. It will be even more astounding if that continues.""",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

It offers light to medium body and pretty, caramelized grapefruit and floral notes with melons. It is dry, crisp, zesty, and ideal for drinking over the next several years.

This 2012 Alión is pure Tempranillo from vineyards averaging 25 to 30 years of age, harvested at the end of September and matured for 14 months in new French oak barrels. The nose is much more elegant than the Pintia from Toro (I tasted them together), still very fresh and primary but with a special brightness of fruit, shiny cherries, raspberries, something effervescent, open and somehow exuberant. The palate is quite round, much more polished, with some notes of dark chocolate, some subtle volatility, elegant, fresh and long. It has the balance and stuffing to develop nicely in bottle. Superb balance, Ribera character, clean, modern classic. 280,000 bottles were produced. After the warm and ripe 2011, this is a much more balanced 2012 Alión that reminded me of the 2001 vintage.""",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

Altesino is now celebrating the release of its 40th harvest. In fact, the 2012 Brunello di Montalcino is inscribed with the words ""our 40th Harvest"" in gold letters on its front label. This is a truly delicious wine that exceeds my expectations. I love the way it takes full command of the slightly bolder and more opulent dark fruit aromas produced in this hot vintage. Black cherry, plum and crème de cassis converge on the bouquet. Grilled herb, forest floor, licorice and exotic spice play supporting roles. The finish offers moderate acidity on the Sangiovese scale. This means the wine is mush fresher and more tonic than most Tuscan reds. The finish is long and silky.- Monica Larner

Cropped from a vintage of average temperatures, but more rain than normal, the 2014 Alto Moncayo followed the usual fermentation in small tanks with neutral yeasts and 18 months in new French and 35% American oak barrels. 2014 was a balanced year with normal yields. Both wines are from old, head-pruned Garnacha vines. They do a selection for Aquilón, sometimes part of the plots and sometimes a barrel selection. This is powerful and concentrated, ripe and generously oaked, finding its balance in an XL style. I found the last couple of vintages better balanced and with better-integrated oak than in the past. This is definitely riper than the 2013, slightly different in style but at a similar level of quality. 54,600 bottles were filled in July 2016.- Luis Gutierrez

A more restrained, elegant, structured vintage for this wine (I suspect more due to winemaking than the vintage), the 2014 Alto Moncayo is 100% Grenache brought up in French and American oak. It sports a vibrant ruby/purple color as well as a ripe, yet elegant style in its black raspberries, blueberry, white pepper, and floral aromas and flavors. Full-bodied and concentrated on the palate, with good acidity and a pure, focused character, it needs an hour in the decanter if drinking anytime soon, and should have 10-12 years of overall longevity. It's reminiscent of a modern styled Châteauneuf du Pape (the cuvée Juline from Paul Autard?) and is a gorgeous wine.- Jeb Dunnuck",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

Anselmi San Vincenzo IGT Veneto,Italy,Veneto,Veneto,"Garganega, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc",14.99,"This is a lovely Italian white wine. Roberto Anselmi left college in 1975 to work in his father’s winery. During and after the horrors of World War II, Roberto's grandfather had been forced to sell the family vineyards, so Roberto's father relied on purchased grapes. Roberto gradually acquired hillside vineyards, which he replanted at high density using the low-yielding Guyot trellis system as opposed to the commonly used but much higher-yielding double pergola system. His clones of Garganega (the white variety of Soave) are less productive and higher quality than is commonly used. Frustrated by the low quality and general lack of ambition in the Soave region, he left the Soave DOC in 2000, and his wines are now labelled IGT Veneto. ‘No one is focused on the real quality,' he says. 'I use 7000 plants/hectare as opposed to 1200. I have 3 bunches per plant as opposed to 15. These are two different philosophies of life.’ The varietals he uses are also distinctive, a blend of 80% Garganega and 10% each Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. Roberto's wines are impressive in a modern, forward style, and they are excellent values. The San Vicenzo shows lovely fruit unobscured by oak. It is very pure and fresh with hints of citrus, apple, and lemon blossom. The palate shows lovely freshness, richness, and style. Wine Spectator: 88 “Fresh and floral, with apricot, grapefruit granita, candied ginger, and stone notes.

B Moreau Chassagne Montrachet Rouge,France,Chassagne Montrachet,Burgundy,Pinot Noir,59.99,"It’s impossible to discuss Chassagne-Montrachet without mentioning the name Bernard Moreau. Year to year, this celebrated producer vinifies and bottles some of the purest, most thought-provoking wines of the appellation. Employing a style of wine making that might best be described as hands-off, Bernard produces Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays that are sensual, opulent and utterly delicious.

The winery’s roots go back to 1809 when Auguste Moreau built a cellar across from the Champs Gain vineyard and farmed his few hectares of Chardonnay and Pinot along the golden slope. The 1930s saw an expansion of the family’s vineyards under the guidance of Marcel Moreau. Roughly 80% of the domaine’s current vineyard holdings were acquired by Marcel. At age 14, Bernard Moreau took over the vineyards and cellar in the early 1960’s. In 1977 the reputation of this great estate was fully established under the leadership of Bernard and Françoise Moreau and the winery was named Domaine Bernard Moreau. In addition to the changes in equipment, farming and wine making, they also purchased additional land bringing the vineyard total to 14 hectares. To help with wine making, viticulture and sales, sons Alex and Benoît joined the Domaine after having worked in New Zealand, Australia and South Africa.

Alex and Benoit have loosely split the responsibilities of the operation with Benoit more focused on the vineyards and Alex more focused on the cellar.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

Badenhorst Secateurs Chenin Blanc,South Africa,Swartland,Western Cape,Chenin Blanc,13.99,"""The Chenin Blanc grapes used are from our farm, Kalmoesfontein, as well as our direct neighbours and are all mountain sloped bushvines. We maintain that high quality fruit comes from old un-irrigated bushvines grown on a variety of granite soils that are naturally low yielding. Most of our Chenin vines were planted the 1960s and tend to yield around 4 tons/hectare. 

The grapes are hand picked with great care and chilled overnight in a cold room. The following day they are whole bunch pressed to a settling tank. These vineyards were picked over a period of 12 days and each day fresh juice was added to the already fermenting tanks  this extended the alcoholic fermentation by about 20 days but was also very important in the complete integration of the wine as all the various vineyards or components were fermented together. Some of the wine was also fermented in old casks  this makes up around 8% of the final blend. Maturation: This wine was left on its gross lees for 7 months before being bottled with occasional lees stirring during this time.  The aromas are flinty with honey, orange blossom and white stone fruit notes.All our wines are minimally fined and filtered so occasionally they will throw a harmless deposit.""",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

The cuvee XIII is predominately Zinfandel blended with Carignane, Petite Sirah, Mourvedre, Alicante Bouchet, Grenache, Syrah, Barbera and a touch of whites for aromatics, much of which comes from old vines.

Caparzo Brunello Di Montalcino,Italy,Brunello Di Montalcino,Tuscany,Sangiovese,39.99,"Caparzo  produced  its  first  vintage  of  Brunello  di  Montalcino  in  1970,  when  the  situation  in Montalcino  was  very  different  than  it  is  now.

The  distinguishing characteristic of Caparzo's Brunello di Montalcino is clearly the origin of its Sangiovese. Indeed, the  estate  is  one  of the few in Montalcino that  has vineyards in the  various geographic  areas  of the  Appellation.  What  might  seem  to  be  just  a  detail  is  instead  quite  positive,  because  the different  locations  of  Caparzo's  vineyards  allow  the  estate  to  draw  the  most  from  the  different microclimates  and  terroirs  present  in  Montalcino.  The  grapes  harvested  from  the  vineyards  in the  various  areas  of  the  appellation  are  carefully  selected  to  lay  the  foundations  for  a  complex wine  that    brings  together  all  of  the  characteristics  that  make  Brunello  one  of  the  the  world's most sought after wines.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

Desvignes Morgon La Voute Saint Vincent,France,Morgon,Beaujolais,Gamay,19.99,"100% Gamay. The beginning of the Desvignes range is La Voûte Saint Vincent, which comes from various estate parcels in the Morgon climat of Douby, north of the Côte du Py and bordering Fleurie. Douby has deeper, sandier, granitic soils and yields a more supple style of Morgon compared to Py's famously muscular one. The vines for La Voûte average 60 years old. Viticulture and vinification are consistent across all Desvignes wines. The vines are organically farmed and harvested by hand. The fruit is generally fermented in whole clusters (with some variation by vintage: in 2017 La Voûte was completely destemmed due to severe hail damage) in open-top concrete vats, with a maceration of 12-13 days and with a submerged cap. La Voûte is bottled in April following the harvest. Annual production is approximately 2000 cases, making it the largest Desvignes bottling. The wine is named for the vault or ""voûte"" of the old family house and for the patron saint of winemakers, St. Vincent.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

Soil: The soils in the vineyard are mainly composed of Kimmeridgian and Portlandian (Upper Jurassic) calcareous clay. The subsoil is limestone.

Viticulture: The soil is worked around each vine to improve microbiological soil life.  Most of the parcels have grass growing between the rows of vines to prevent soil erosion and ensure better ripening of the grapes.  No herbicides, insecticides, etc. are employed. Practicing organic but not yet certified.  The vines are pruned according to the single Guyot method and later in the growing cycle the winemakers perform disbudding and green harvest to an extent that varies each year in order to limit production and obtain healthy and homogenous grapes.

Harvest: Manual harvest; sorting of the grapes on the sorting table.  The choice of growing methods used and the harvest date are crucial to ensure that the grapes reach their peak of ripeness.

Vinification: The winemakers use gravity (no pumping). The juice, and later on the wine, is handled as little as possible so that it expresses all of the aromatic characteristics the terroirs have to offer.  Gentle pressing of the grapes. Vinification and aging in clay cement tanks on the fine lees for 8 months (depending on the vintage).

Tasting Notes: Clear, straw color.  The nose is expressive with notes of citrus and a hint of tropical fruits.  On the palate, it is fresh and vibrant, ripe yet balanced, and not at all aggressive.  Medium length on the fruity finish.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

There is no use of herbicides. The soil is regularly ploughed to develop the biodiversity: the Domaine des Billards is today a paradise for worms and beetles!

The origin of the name Vieux Lazaret dates back to the 18th century when there existed in the center of the village of Châteauneuf-du-Pape a hospice or Lazaret. This offered comfort and shelter for the poor and infirm, provided by the Lazarists, who were a silent order of monks founded in 1625 by St Vincent de Paul to look after the sick and the needy in the French countryside. They took the name Lazarists from the Priory of St Lazare in Paris, where the original order had been formed in 1632.

The Lazarists in Châteauneuf-du-Pape played a major role in taking in and looking after the sick during the terrible epidemic of the plague, which killed a third of the population in 1720. Subsequently the buildings fell into disuse and were sold by the Commune during the 19th century to the Quiot family and used as agricultural buildings. Being situated in the village of Châteauneuf-du-Pape and close to other properties owned by the Quiot family, these original buildings have today been extended and modernised, and now form the center of winemaking for Vignobles Famille Quiot. With this historical association going back over several centuries, the Quiot family decided in 1915 to give the name of Domaine du Vieux Lazaret to their principal Domaine.

Today, Domaine du Vieux Lazaret is exported to more than 43 countries around the world. It can be found on the best tables and regularly wins medals in wine competitions throughout the world.

Vineyards
The vineyards of Domaine du Vieux Lazaret are spread over 93 hectares (230 acres), split into 35 different parcels of vines throughout A.O.C. Châteauneuf-du-Pape. It is today amongst the largest domaines in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, with 83 hectares (205 acres) planted in red grape varieties and 10 planted with white grapes. The number of parcels enables the Domaine to give greater complexity to its wines due to the diversity of soils, grape types and differing ages of vines.

Viticulture
The viticultural practices are strictly controlled and follow those traditions practised for many generations. The pruning is only done by those vineyard workers who are extremely experienced, and follow the strict rules of the appellation, with some vines trained on wires and others trained low to the ground. The soil in the vineyard is regularly worked to allow proper aeration, with regular application of compost, and other treatments to maintain the best organic level and condition of the soil. Harvesting of the grapes is done entirely by hand, with very strict selection of the best grapes to enhance the quality of the Domaine wine. The vines have an average age of 40 years.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

The Chardonnay for this Cablis was sourced from from eight different areas, which are mainly located on the left bank of the Serein river, Pargues in the Forêts valley, and Vaillons. They are blended with the parcel located just below the Montée de Tonnerre. The wine itself bursts open with a lovely aromatic profile of green apples, peach skin, lime zest and hints of dragon fruit, which are laced with crushed stones and oyster shell nuances.

Era Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,Italy,Montepulciano D'abruzzo,Abruzzo,Montepulciano,12.99,"Montepulciano d’Abruzzo is a red wine made in the Abruzzi district of Italy from Montepulciano grapes. The cheapest ones are uncomplicated and uninteresting wines. The best are bold, vivid, powerhouse wines that may lack finesse, but they offer intense fruit and a lot of bang for the buck. This example is somewhere in the middle. It has plenty of fruit and much more finesse than the highly extracted, big ones. It’s also half the price.

ERA Montepulciano comes from the Chieti area of Abruzzo. It is medium-ruby in color with red cherry, dried fruit, subtle oak, and savory herb aromas. The wine is medium-bodied with a soft texture, very pleasing berry fruit, light cedar, and more savory herb notes on the palate. It is organic (and vegan and vegetarian). Actually the label says “made with organic grapes.” This designation requires strict organic practices in the vineyard and in the winery, but allows the use of sulfites in the making of the wine, although they are generally minimal. A “certified organic” designation on the label does not allow for the use of sulfites. Many early “made with organic grapes” wines were poorly made with off aromas and flavors, but this one is modern, clean, balanced, and bright. 

Cantina Volpi began their organic ERA projects in 1999 out of concerns for environmental issues. Cantina Volpi has wineries in Veneto, Marche, Abruzzo, Apulia, and Sicily. They work with organically certified vineyards in each of these regions. All vineyard work is done by hand, and fermentation is uses only natural yeast. Certification is made by I.C.E.A. (the Italian Institute for Ethic and Environmental Certification), which is accredited in the U.S. by the USDA.  The goddess Era was the Queen of Olympus in Greek mythology.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

Foxglove expands that range with moderately priced wines like this Paso Robles Cabernet, which is bold and intense yet not at all a fruit bomb. It’s juicy and balanced and will go well with steaks and chops.” Varner Vineyards is the life and love of Jim and Bob Varner. Bob is the winemaker, Jim is the business guy. They grow the grapes for their estate Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays around the winery in Santa Cruz. The grapes for the foxglove wines are purchased. The Cabernet Sauvignon, which is a nearly 11,000-case cuvée, comes from northern Paso Robles from all hillside vineyards and represents a soft, round, juicy, succulent style of Cabernet.

Franzia Pinot Grigio,United States,na,California,Pinot Grigio,17.99,"Since 1906. The world's most popular wine. Award winning wines. The Story Behind Franzia: A new beginning - Teresa Franzia, my grandmother, planted her first vineyard along the road to Yosemite in 1906. Her family survived Prohibition by selling these grapes to home wine makers back East. When Prohibition ended, my father and his six brothers and sisters rebuilt the winery brick by brick, barrel by barrel - everyone pitched in. After the war, my uncles new advertising slogan, make friends with Franzia, introduced a new generation to wine. Our revolutionary fresh to the last glass Winetap system made its debut in 1978. Because it was more convenient and offered better value than bottles, Franzia started to catch on. It went on to become the world's most popular wine and the first (and only) Winetap to freshness date every package. As we enter our second century of winemaking, we strive to uphold Teresa's legacy of quality, freshness and value. Not just by winning competitions around the world, but more importantly, by helping to bring the enjoyment of good wine to your home each night. The World's most popular wine is also the World's most cost and carbon efficient wine. We are proud of what we are doing and we plan to do more. Significantly Less CO2 Emissions: Franzia WineTaps use significantly smaller energy resources in packaging production and fabrication. Significantly Less Packaging Waste: With 85% less landfill waste than traditional glass, Franzia WineTaps dramatically reduce the environmental burden of excess packaging. Smaller Carbon Footprint: 50% more carbon efficient than 750ml glass bottles. Lighter than heavy glass bottles, Franzia WineTaps require fewer trucks to deliver the same amount of wine resulting in less emissions, less pollution, less cost and less greenhouse gases. Less Wine Waste: This award-winning wine stays fresh to the last glass, even after the package has been opened, because Franzia's patented spout and unique inner pouch prevent the oxidation that occurs in half empty wine-in-bottles. Enjoy for at least 6 weeks after opening. Alc 12% by volume.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

citrus blossom. A generous palate with citrus and cassis flavours, deliciously ripe and succulent, finishing with that classic Marlborough zing. Fruit was sourced from various prime vineyard sites in Marlborough’s Southern Valleys and the central Wairau Plains, specifically in Woodbourne, Renwick and Rapaura. Soil types vary from the young alluvial soils of Rapaura and Renwick, which contain high proportions of New Zealand’s ubiquitous greywacke river stones, to the older and denser clay-loams of the Southern Valleys. The majority of the vineyards were trained using the divided Scott Henry canopy management system, with the balance on a two- or three-cane VSP (vertical shoot positioning) trellis. Sauvignon blanc was harvested largely by machine during the cool (often cold) night-time conditions. Fruit was harvested directly into half-tonne bins, which were tipped directly into a tank press. The grapes were pressed relatively lightly and the resulting juice was cold-settled prior to fermentation. The juice was fermented in stainless steel tanks, primarily
using cultured yeast with a cool, slow fermentation. A portion was allowed to undergo spontaneous indigenous yeast fermentation using slightly warmer fermentation regimes.
All individual vineyard batches were left on lees and kept separate until late July, when the blend was assembled.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

One voice boomed back to the listeners on Earth declaring, ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."" This brand focuses on the emotions at play during the American Space Age, producing a grounded authenticity that speaks of the wine inside.

After being picked cold in the early morning hours, we follow a rigorous program modeled after the techniques used to produce our favorite southern-France rosés. Whole clusters go directly to into the press upon arrival, and the delicate juice is slowly fermented at ultra-low temperatures en route to early bottling, all in our quest to preserve maximum freshness.

With its classic pale pink “eye of the partridge color,” prized by rosé producers in Provence, the 2018 Space Age Rosé delivers an amazingly fresh, vibrant rush of bright aromas of strawberry, rose petal hibiscus and cranberry. The crisp natural acidity keeps these aromas alive and fresh on the palate and through the surprisingly long, fragrant finish.

When the wine has breathed slightly, a discreet dash of vanilla coupled with nuances of fresh butter and freshly baked bread. Flavors are supple, honest and powerful. The wine seems to launch into lively aromas that are lightness itself, perfectly orchestrated scents of cooked fruits admirably sharpened by a dash of eau-de-vie, preserve figs and quince jelly. Sparkling with fine fresh bubbles, the wine grows rounder as it develops, offering heady notes of exotic fruits (mango, lychees and passion fruit).
Pair with a white meat (veal, poultry) in a creamy sauce or a sweet-sour meal (duck with pears or peaches) are ideal partners of this lively champagne.

The oak used for our barrels is sourced from the Écueil forest or from Champagne-Ardenne. Each plot is pressed and vinified separately and the juice is moved by gravity as far as possible and not pumped, to conserve the musts’ intrinsic qualities. Fermentations are temperature controlled and monitored daily. The wines stay in tank or barrel in contact with their lees deposits, without racking, for the whole autumn period, so they develop their full complexity and unique personality. For the wines made in oak barrels, no stirring or filtering is carried out. The chilling process then takes place... outside in the winter cold! The bottles are aged in our cellars for between 30 months and 7 years. This is followed by an average resting time of 3 to 6 months after the yeast deposits have been removed (disgorgement). The optimum ""dosage"" for each wine in each year is decided by several trial tastings. Our objective is to find the best possible balance as each wine is a living being with its own character.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

Lustau Solera Reserva Fino Jarana Sherry,Spain,Jerez,na,Palomino Fino,14.99,"The NV Fino Jarana, aged in Jerez, has a beautiful, classical Fino nose of chalk, dry hay, dry straw (esparto) and nuts, while the palate is very dry, intense and pungent, long, with a pleasant bitter finish. It's both intense and fine. Drink 2013-2014.  Emilio Lustau is one of the better internationally known names in the Sherry world, which is quite remarkable, as they have never been a very big operation. In fact they can be considered a small- to medium-sized bodega for Sherry; they were selling around 350,000 bottles per year. Furthermore, when more and more bodegas and important names have disappeared, been bought and sold, brands and soleras acquired by big drink corporations, Brandy or other businesses cannibalizing wine in some of the bigger companies, it's refreshing to see a firm still betting firmly on Sherry and working so hard to improve their ranges and their international presence, trying new products (they have produced a small lot of unfiltered biologically aged wine from the three different towns, Jerez, El Puerto and Sanlucar) and experimenting in many different ways. Their range might be too wide (35 to 40 different wines), but that works for them, as they can diversify in different markets and have the correct wine for the price and quality required. They also pioneered the idea to bottle small lots from almacenistas (small bodegas who produce and age wine that they sell to other bodegas rather than offering bottled to consumers) showing the name of the almacenista and the village where the wine has aged. Emilio Lustau was created in 1896 by Jose Ruiz-Berdejo who was himself an almacenista in Jerez; he worked his vineyards and produced wines that he sold to the big exporting houses. In 1940 his son-in-law Emilio Lustau took over and enlarged the business, which in 1950 became an exporting firm. Through the 70's and 80's they continued combining tradition with new ways and ideas. In 1990 the company was bought by Luis Caballero, a businessman from El Puerto de Santa Maria in love with Sherry, whose stellar product was Ponche Caballero, the number one liqueur in Spain at the time. He enlarged the company, purchasing vineyards and in 2001 he acquired some bodegas from their neighbors, Harveys, in Jerez, like the impressive 14-meter high Los Arcos and Las Cruces. In 2008 they bought some famous brands and soleras that had belonged to Domecq and were true icons of Sherry wine in Spain, 4,000 botas in total, 2,600 of them of Fino La Ina, perhaps the better known Sherry brand locally together with Tio Pepe from Gonzalez-Byass. This will bring them additional volume, mainly in the local market, perhaps to become a half-million bottle per year winery. Walking around the bodegas with director Federico Sanchez-Pece, I bumped into some newish-looking barrels and showed surprise. Oh! These are botas that belong to Jameson, we fill them with Oloroso and they stay here two or three years before they take them to Ireland to use them for the aging of their whisky. Breaking new barrels with wine to take away the harsh tannins and the excessive aromatic components of the wood is called envinar in Spanish. Apparently this is a common side-business in some Sherry bodegas, wining' (envinar) new botas for whisky producers, or even selling small quantities of their own, used botas for finishing small lots of special whisky. I have to say that I was extremely impressed with their VORS range, which showed very old, powerful, quality wines and had the feeling that the quality of the Lustau wines seems to be on the way up.<br/>Imported by Europvin, www.europvin.com",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

For single-vineyard wines, special blocks, clones or barrels may be selected and thoughtfully combined. Likewise, our Russian River Pinot is, in a way, the grandest of our blends, as its goal is to portray the heart of our valley. This Pinot Noir’s kaleidoscopic personality was created by melding five unique vineyards, eight singular clones and 12 individual lots.
The bouquet of this wine uncovers memories of ripening blackberry fields, berry compote and warm plum clafoutis. The complexity of frothed and aromatic Mexican chocolate, with its cinnamon, nutmeg, rich cocoa butter and nutty flavor is found here also. Wood-grilled meat, mushrooms and other earthy notes accompany the sweet, toasty and supportive oak.
Smooth and round on the entry, the palate is powerful yet supple, imparting an impression of thickness. Tannins build tension across the body in line with a balanced acid profile. Generous fruit carries over from the aroma joined by dried fig, sarsaparilla and a lingering toastiness. Polished and firm on the finish, this wine has many years to unfold.

Michael David Winery Earthquake Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Lodi,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,22.99,"The Phillips family has been farming since our Great Great Grandfather Andrew Harshner and his wife Lucille homesteaded 160 acres near the town of Lodi, following the Civil War in the 1860s. The region’s natural affinity for grape growing quickly became evident, and by the turn of the century (the last one), twenty-five percent of California’s grape acreage was in Lodi. A generation later saw the demise of many pioneering wineries in the state.
Originally devoted to vegetables, the Phillips’ farms evolved to include many different fruits, including fifteen different wine varietals that were shipped throughout the country during Prohibition with instructions on “how not to have the grapes turn into wine”. Thereby, Prohibition was good for Lodi growers, with families everywhere keeping up the tradition of wine with meals by ordering these grapes and “juice” to be bottled at home.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

It is planted in our Louis Mel vineyard located across the arroyo that runs directly in front of our historic tasting room property. This vineyard is part of the original 92-acre parcel Louis Mel purchased when he first moved to the Livermore Valley. Featuring an elevation range of 575-715 feet above sea level, the Louis Mel vineyard features well-drained gravelly soils that are ideal for growing Sauvignon Blanc.  

The wine was fermented in a combination of stainless steel tanks and neutral French oak barrels. The oak barrels allow the wine to breath and mature during fermentation and early aging, but does not impart oak qualities to the wine. Aged sur lie for four months in neutral French oak barrels with minimal battonage. This adds texture and weight to the palate while maintaining the wines freshness.  

All of these varieties were picked in October 2019. The 2019 vintage was moderate to warm in the Livermore Valley, without any heat spikes. This allowed the fruit to get extra hang time on the vine, which brought out the fruit and floral qualities even more. Overall, we saw good yields, healthy fermentations and high quality wines.  Our 2019 Sauvignon Blanc exhibits aromas of lime zest, green apple and basil, complemented by floral notes of spring blossoms and a gravely minerality. As a barrel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc, with lees aging, this wine presents a layered and textured palate with a balancing acidity that maintains its varietal uniqueness as well as establishing itself as an excellent food wine.

The Valtellina region, located at the base of the pre-Alps on Italy’s border with Switzerland, is an extremely challenging terroir. A narrow, 25 mile-long amphitheater of terraced vineyards that line the north bank of the Adda River, form a deep gorge amid mountainous terrain. This is Italy’s largest terraced area of viticulture: an impressive 1,500 miles of dry walls that support the terraces are distributed over the 25-mile strip. Working this land is a monumental, backbreaking toil.

Steep, nearly vertical vineyards from 2,400 to 3,000 feet elevation rule out the use of any mechanical equipment. All work, from removing soil to harvesting grapes is done by hand. The star and primary varietal here is Chiavennasca, the local name for Nebbiolo. The variety has been cultivated here for over 1,000 years and it is said that it was brought from here to neighboring Piedmont in the 14th Century.

Pesquera Crianza Tinto,Spain,Ribera Del Duero,na,Tempranillo,32.99,"Elaborated for lovers of good wine who bet for a safe value. A world famous wine that reflects the character of an entire land full of stories, customs and charm; where modernity and tradition go hand in hand. A mythical wine to enjoy now and in a few years that will delight any palate. Distinguished by its personality, bouquet and structure. A gift for the senses, unalterable in the face of wine-making, with an exceptional value for the money.

The 1970’s brought the realization of a lifetime dream for a young and determined Alejandro Fernández. Propelled by his conviction that wines of superb quality could once again be made in the place of his birth, he went against the movement of the time, when cereal and beetroot dominated the Riberanhillsides, and planted Tempranillo vineyards in his hometown of Pesquera. In 1982, this iconic winemaking pioneer, who came to be recognized as the “Master of Tempranillo,” was the keystone in forming the now-famous D.O. Ribera del Duero, a designation that Alejandro helped to create with only a few other winemaking pioneers.

Tinto Pesquera’s 200 hectares of vineyards lie near the Duero River at close to 2,400 feet in elevation. The vines grow in poor, well-drained soils, composed of sand and gravel over a limestone and clay subsoil, and are naturally irrigated with water from the nearby Duero River. Tinto Pesquera’s vines are located within the province of Valladolid, in the heart of Ribera del Duero, which has hot summers, incredibly cold winters and extreme diurnal temperature differences that create an ideal combination for producing silky and sumptuous Tempranillo wines. The Tinto Pesquera Crianza is made from estate-grown, 40-year-old vines that produce a limited production of only two kilos per vine.",Gary's Wayne,"1308 NJ-23, Wayne, NJ 07470, USA"

Pio Cesare Barolo,Italy,Barolo,Piedmont,Nebbiolo,69.99,"<font size=""16px"" color=""#800000""><b>WA 95</b></font>
The Pio Cesare 2013 Barolo offers all of the plentiful qualities that make this such a memorable vintage. Because the growing season was slightly cooler compared to the two years preceding it, 2013 offers a great sense of freshness and brightness. Fruit was sourced from seven different vineyard sites (with much of it coming from Serralunga d'Alba). Starting in 2015, Monforte d'Alba fruit will be added. The tannins are tightly integrated within the firm fabric of the wine. Yet, the finish is round and supple. This Barolo offers characteristic aromas of wild berry, black truffle and cola. It is executed in a very traditional style with botte grande and a tiny part barrique to give the wine a tad more oxygen during its integration and aging process.- Monica Larner
<font size=""16px"" color=""#800000""><b>VM 90</b></font>
The 2013 Barolo is a very pretty wine from proprietor Pio Boffa. As always, the blend of sites Pio Cesare favors yields a distinctive Barolo with quite a bit of complexity. Medium in body and intensely aromatic, the 2013 can be enjoyed with minimal cellaring. The orange peel, exotic spice, kirsch and mint notes all give the wine plenty of allure, while the tannins are quite soft for a young Barolo. All the elements are very nicely balanced. Pio Cesare's Barolo is a wine that does not seem to get much attention, but it is consistently delicious, fairly priced and relatively easy to find, a combination of virtues that is noteworthy.

 Coppola Diamond Chardonnay,United States,na,California,Chardonnay,11.99,"âIâve always been influenced by the idea of Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, which was the inspiration for ultimately all modern amusements parks. I remember the beautiful theater pavilions with the curtains painted with peacock feathers that had little ballet performances. At Tivoli, there were rides, but more important than the rides were the cafes and the refreshments, and just the sense of being in a childrenâs garden, a âpleasure gardenâ for all people to enjoy - which perhaps is the best phrase to describe what weâre creating here. This vision was replicated at places on Coney Island, like Luna Park, and George C. Tilyouâs Steeplechase Park, or Palisades Park. These were basically wonderlands, and I thought Francis Ford Coppola Winery could become such a park for the family to go and enjoy, where there are things for kids to do, so they can be close to their parents who are sampling wines and foods.Iâve often felt that modern life tends to separate all the ages too much. In the old days, the children lived with the parents and the grandparents, and the family unit each gave one another something very valuable. So when we began to develop the idea for this winery, we thought it should be like a resort, basically a wine wonderland, a park of pleasure where people of all ages can enjoy the best things in life - food, wine, music, dancing, games, swimming and performances of all types. A place to celebrate the love of life.â- Francis Ford CoppolaFor more than thirty years, we have been committed to environmentally responsible business practices. Itâs been our goal to minimize our impact on the environment by seeking out innovative ways to produce and package our goods.At Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all 24 planted acres are sustainably farmed and part of the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program. We try to purchase fruit from growers who farm sustainably, and some of the vineyards we source from are certified organic as well. Another benefit of participating in the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program is that we have subsequently become a learning-teaching vineyard. Every technique we implement is thoroughly documented so that we, and neighboring Sonoma winegrowers, can pinpoint the best ways to protect our land and craft the best wines from these vineyards.We are also actively involved in the Fish Friendly Farming certification program. While this may seem like a matter totally unrelated to wine, watershed quality management is intrinsically connected to farming our vineyard because our property includes two blue-line creeks. These creeks are a part of the Russian River watershed that supports steelhead trout and Coho salmon populations. In conjunction with our neighbors and local, state, and federal agencies, we work diligently to promote the overall health of the Russian River watershed so that the entire ecosystem remains in balance and is preserved for generations to come.Our winegrowing practices involve the Integrated Pest Management program, which discusses the best practices for maintaining soil and vine health and proactively farming to reduce and treat pest pressures. Field experts provide monthly lectures concerning pest problems and solutions which we implement in our vineyard. Through our integrated pest management program, we have complemented the biodiversity of our vineyard by promoting the presence of beneficial insects, soil fauna, and owls that combat pests of grapevines.Finally, we recycle our grape and water waste by fertilizing with composted grape pomace and irrigating only with reclaimed winery wastewater.  In effect, we have closed the loop on our waste system in an effort to reduce our carbon footprint on the land we so love.Outside of the vineyard, our Francis Coppola Diamond Collection wines are packaged in 100% recycled cardboard case boxes, and all of the corks we purchase come from sustainable cork forests. Additionally, we insist that the label and foil companies we do business with have environmentally friendly practices as well.During the reconstruction of Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all of the crews, vendors, and sub-contractors we hired were local residents, helping to cut down on transportation costs, as well as supporting the economy of our community.Rather than use new lumber for the construction, we reused the wood from the Redwood trees that were removed from the courtyard area. Some of this timber was used to build the main reception desk in the Guest Services building, while other portions has been used to build the outdoor dining tables. The pyramid skylights in our towers feature an environmentally friendly material called Kalwall to construct skylights. This material diffuses light in such a way that little artificial lighting is needed, which helps conserve energy.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Sycamore Lane Pinot Grigio,United States,na,California,Pinot Gris,4.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the worldâs leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Marioâs son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his familyâs efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a âstuckâ fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Homeâs original philosophy to offer âa great product for a fair price,â even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

Marioâs son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his familyâs efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a âstuckâ fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Homeâs original philosophy to offer âa great product for a fair price,â even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley.

 Cakebread Chardonnay,United States,Napa County,California,Chardonnay,39.99,"Our Chardonnay fruit was 100% whole-cluster-pressed to minimize astringency from the skins. Pressing the fruit cold assures even lower extraction of astringent compounds, which also increases the long term aging potential in white wines. Three quarters of the juice was barrel fermented in 35% new French oak barrels at 50-55Âº F, a slow, cool fermentation that fostered a perfect balance of ripe fruit, yeast, natural acidity and toasty oak. The remaining portion was fermented in stainless steel tanks, with those lots transferred to barrel once fermentation completed. While barrel fermentation promotes complexity and richness, tank fermentation maximizes fruit intensity. Partial malolactic fermentation, primarily of the higher acid lots, further enhanced the harmony of these elements. During nine months of barrel aging, the wines were frequently hand stirred to promote the integration of fruit, yeast, acid and oak, resulting in a beautifully balanced Chardonnay of elegant richness.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

Armed with a copy of the latest Wine Spectator, founder Kevin Mehra set out on a mission to bring higher quality wine to the market for a better price. He started calling wineries with a history of high ratings to ask if they had extra wine for sale. Some told him to get lost, but in the end, he found a handful of wineries that liked his concept. The plan was simple: we put their wine in our bottle, and sell it for less.But why would wineries want to do that?You may recall that the economy wasnât in the best shape in 2009. Demand for wines priced more than $20 a bottle had plummeted and inventories were piling up. Rather than discount their wine and erode the value of their brand, we found that wineries were willing to part with a certain percentage of their production for a reduced price.It was a win/win scenario. Wineries got to sell more wine, and consumers got access to better wine at lower prices.The landscape has changed quite a bit since we launched; but our mission and our ability to offer great wine has not. With our head wine buyer, Brett Vankoski, at the helm we continue to seek out the best opportunities in the market and turn those into great values in the bottle for you.

 Gary Farrell Pinot Noir Russian River,United States,Sonoma County,California,Pinot Noir,34.99,"Our founder Gary Farrell was a passionate believer in great vineyards. Long before the Russian River Valley made its mark on the world stage, Gary was out exploring vineyards in the early 1980s to identify grapes from the most promising sites in the valley.With an uncannily prophetic eye to the future, the first wine he produced under the Gary Farrell label was a 1982 Pinot Noir sourced from what would eventually become two of the Russian River Valleyâs premier vineyards: Rochioli and Allen. Planted just up the road from where he would build his winery, these sites are adjacent to each other on Westside Road and have been meticulously farmed by Joe Rochioli, Jr. for more than 40 years.The success of our wines comes down to relationships like the one we enjoy with Joe and his family. We are committed to maintaining the strong, long-term partnerships weâve established with the owners of the iconic Russian River Valley vineyards that form the heart of our wine portfolio, including Westside Farms, Rochioli, Allen, Stiling, Hallberg and more.For the past few years, we have established new relationships with even more of our neighboring Russian River Valley growers. Weâve added exciting new vineyard sources to our portfolio including Ritchie, Bacigalupi, Pellegrini Olivet Lane Estate and Martinelli, to name just a few. Additionally, we continue to work with exceptional vineyard sites outside of the Russian River Valley to add intriguing counterpoints to our portfolio. These include newer sources like Durell Vineyard in Sonoma Valley, as well as long-standing sites such as Bradford Mountain in Dry Creek Valley and the classic Bien Nacido Vineyard of the Santa Maria Valley, both of which we have been working with for more than a decade.When selecting new sites to work with, each vineyard is critically assessed for the specific climate conditions we require. In nearly every vineyard site we work with, cool breezes and fog from the nearby Pacific Ocean blanket the vines in the mornings and evenings during the growing season, tempering summerâs heat and reducing temperatures by 35-40 degrees at night, ensuring a long, even growing season. The slow ripening process that results fully matures the fruit while maintaining healthy levels of acidity. Here in the Russian River Valley, the wide range of volcanic, sandstone and alluvial soils is favorable for Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, providing essential water drainage while retaining sufficient moisture and nutrients to nourish the vines during the appellationâs long growing season.These specific conditions yield wines boasting bright, vibrant aromas, intense, yet supple flavors and exemplary balance. Our wines display these characteristics in spades, along with a remarkable purity and elegance of varietal expression.Along with the heritage vineyards our reputation has been firmly built upon, these new vineyard sources give Winemaker Theresa Heredia an even broader palette of flavor and texture to work with in the winery.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

Geographically, however, Obsidian Ridge was the exact opposite of Poseidonâs Vineyard, whose seaside location is ideal for cool climate Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.At 2,640 feet, the site is  covered with black, glassy Obsidian rock â surely Cabernet country. So, we planted 105 acres of Bordeaux clones (including a little RhÃ´ne-based Syrah) on a piece of land that was formerly an abandoned walnut orchard. As the pictures can attest, there was quite a bit of obsidian rock to pull out. But you canât beat the views.

 Jayson Pahlmeyer Red Wine Napa Valley,United States,Napa County,California,Bordeaux Blend,54.99,"The Pahlmeyer story is a tale of international intrigue, passion and Hollywood stardomâ¦ Of Jayson Pahlmeyer, friends and familyâ¦ Of French clones, legendary winemaking and iconic wines...Once upon a time, there was a man with a bold, irrepressible spirit - a trial attorney called to the profession by its fast and furious nature.While successful in his career, a hypnotic captivation with wine soon eclipsed his legal ambitions. He had an insatiable thirst for adventure and a certainty that Northern California (his native soil) held considerable winegrowing potential. Was it destiny that Jayson Pahlmeyerâs world was turned happily upside down? Who can say?Following his dream, Jayson partnered with the owner of a 55-acre site in south-east Napa Valley. The two shared a devotion to Jaysonâs audacious dream of creating a âCalifornia Mouton,â and began imagining the vineyardâs potential. The key, they were sure, lay in planting the finest French clones of the red Bordeaux varieties - a considerable roadblock since importing clones is an international offense.After months of sleuthing in elite French vineyards, Jaysonâs partner sought the assistance of the venerable viticultural professors at the University of Bordeaux. The professors analyzed soil samples, exposure, rainfall and temperature data from the land and recommended the Californians grow corn.Undaunted, Jayson and his partner persevered until after three years the professors isolated the exact Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec vines with the greatest intensity, depth of flavor and character.Jaysonâs partner smuggled their âsuitcase clonesâ to the U.S. through Canada. All went off without a hitch until their final truckload, when the border authorities uncovered the French vines. Ordered to surrender all their contraband, they kept their French clones hidden and instead turned over to the unwitting patrollers clones purchased from U.C. Davis.Planted in 1981, the French cuttings adjusted to their shock at a snailâs pace. Catching wind of these crazy guys and their Bordeaux vines, one of Californiaâs foremost winemakers, Randy Dunn, visited the site and warned, âDonât screw it up.â Clearly they didnât because in 1986, seeing unparalleled promise, Randy asked to purchase the entire crop. Jayson agreed - on one condition: that Randy make Jaysonâs âPahlmeyerâ Napa Valley Bordeaux blend.Anointed 94 points by Robert Parker, the first release, the 1986 Pahlmeyer Proprietary Red, launched Pahlmeyerâs astonishing track record of critical acclaim.In 1989, Jayson invited rising star winemaker Bob Levy to produce the first vintages of Pahlmeyer Chardonnay. The 1991 Chardonnay sold out immediately, giving Jayson good reason to decline a screenwriterâs request for samples to use in a Hollywood movie. In the end, though, he acquiesced, and to his great surprise, the wineâs big role in the battle-of-the-sexes blockbuster Disclosure helped further the frenzy surrounding Pahlmeyer. In 1993, Helen Turley took the winemaking reins, beginning her own rise to prominence. She and her team - including protege Erin Green - furthered the work of Dunn and Levy, improving the quality and consistency of Pahlmeyer wines through winegrowing, grape sourcing and winemaking innovation.To push quality to even greater heights, Helen urged Jayson to develop estate vineyards. She was instrumental in finding Pahlmeyerâs high-elevation Napa Valley estate vineyard, planted in 1998 to red Bordeaux varieties and Chardonnay. In that same year, a stoneâs throw from her famed Marcassin Vineyard on the extreme Sonoma Coast, she found the Wayfarer estate ideally situated for growing Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Both estate vineyards were planted by viticulture legend David Abreu in 1998 and 2002, respectively.In 2012, Jayson named Bibiana Gonzalez Rave winemaker for Wayfarer, to oversee his new wines from the estate vineyard, then ten years old and perfectly poised for a solo bottling. She immediately went to work meticulously optimizing the vineyards and realizing his dream to create world class Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. In 2016, her role expanded across all of the Napa Valley operations and Pahlmeyer winemaking.Pahlmeyerâs viticultural practices demand low yields while commanding maximum flavor intensity. Farming in one- to two-acre blocks with a palette of as many as 12 clones for each variety, Pahlmeyerâs world-class pedigree of artisanal winemaking continues to rise to new heights as Bibiana pushes the envelope on clone and vineyard management, as well as cellar and winemaking equipment and practices. In 2008, Jaysonâs daughter Cleo joined the team, bringing the next generation into the Pahlmeyer legacy and launching the Wayfarer brand.And so it is that vintage after vintage, Pahlmeyer continues to live up to Jaysonâs audacious dream - producing phenomenal wines of power and finesse.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the worldâs leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Marioâs son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his familyâs efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a âstuckâ fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Homeâs original philosophy to offer âa great product for a fair price,â even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley.

 Trentadue La Storia Petite Sirah,United States,Sonoma County,California,Petite Sirah,22.99,"The Trentadue family arrived in Sonoma County long before the region gained a reputation as the Wine Country. Life-long, hands-on agriculturists, Evelyn and Leo Trentadue contributed significantly to the advancement of their region over the years. In 1959, the Trentadues decided to flee the developers encroaching on their apricot and cherry orchards in Sunnyvale, the area known today around the world as Silicon Valley. To preserve their way of life, these hard-working Italian ranchers purchased 208 acres of land in Sonoma Countyâs then remote Alexander Valley.There was little market for the regionâs dry-farmed apples, prunes, pears, and grapes in the late 1950s, so land was cheap and plentiful. Scores of ranches were for sale but, because it was blessed with an excellent combination of climate, soil, and water, Leo settled on a special piece of property in the heart of the Alexander Valley. Little did he know what this ranch had once been, much less what it was to become.The piece of land, which is now home to Trentadue Winery, has a remarkable history. In 1868, a French botanist named Andrew Bouton established Heartâs Desire Nursery on this excellent site east of the railroad tracks. With a passion for breeding new and improved strains of fruit trees, Bouton devoted himself to plant propagation, becoming a major supplier of young tree stock to orchardists throughout the western United States. His reputation attracted the attention of a young man named Luther Burbank who visited Bouton frequently. Influenced by Bouton, Burbank conducted his own work in nearby Sebastopol and Santa Rosa.Shaping the Trentadue Estate Vineyards and WineryLeo Trentadue has a reputation for openness to new ideas. Over the years, this inveterate tinkerer has been among the first to experiment with what resulted in a number of viticultural/wine industry innovations. An overview of his unheralded achievements: From dry farming to irrigation. Horse drawn plows and dry farming were still practiced when the Trentadues arrived in the Alexander Valley. Leo introduced advanced irrigation practices common to his former home in Santa Clara County.The Trentadues were among the very first to plant new vines in Sonoma County since the days of Prohibition. Italians love their red wines, especially hearty reds like Carignane. In 1962, the Trentadue family began planting new Carignane vines in addition to the 68 acres of old vines already growing on their ranch. Now more than 115 years old, these vines are among the oldest producing Carignane vineyards in America. The family remains steadfastly devoted to this grape, and their wine ranks indisputably among just a handful of top ranked California Carignane. These vines continue to provide valuable character in many of our award winning wines.Understanding the importance of growing only those grape varieties, which excelled in his vineyards, in 1974 Leo installed half-acre blocks of eight different varietals. The quality of the Sangiovese was extraordinary, so all other vines were replanted to this famed variety from Tuscany. Because Evelyn and Leo share a Tuscan heritage, it is not surprising that in 1984 Trentadue was the first producer to release a 100% varietal wine named for this famed grape of Italy. The superior quality of this fruit has produced our most popular Tasting Room wine and has been the backbone for our La Storia Cuvee 32 blend, which is consistently one of the top wines produced from the Trentadue Estate.Leo had produced an incredible, award-winning 1973 Angelica and finally, in 1987, he encouraged his winemaker to experiment with fortified wines. An excellent Petite Sirah Port resulted, among the very first of its kind. The wine was well received, so a Merlot Port and eventually a Zinfandel Port were added to the line. Over the years, Trentadue has become the leading producer of dessert wines in the area, including the wildly popular Chocolate Amore.Connection to Ridge VineyardsThis wineryâs story cannot be told without mention of the Trentaduesâ remarkable long-term relationship with Paul Draper of Ridge Vineyards. Their personal history began in 1952 when the Trentadues became Paulâs neighbor in Santa Clara, after buying an old abandoned wine estate at the end of Montebello Road. Paul began buying fruit from their ancient vines, striking up a friendship which continues to this day.Both Draper and the Trentadues know a good thing when they see it. Draper was quick to benefit from the Trentaduesâ aptitude for viticulture. The Trentadues have similarly benefited from Draperâs wine business savvy. Indeed, it is Draper who encouraged the family to take advantage of their location and establish an estate winery.The list of mutual benefits derived from the Trentadue and Ridge association is extensive: Fruit from the Trentaduesâ Geyserville estate has been sold to Ridge Vineyards every vintage since 1967. In 1974, Ridge Vineyard acquired the Trentaduesâ mountaintop winery and vineyard today known as Montebello. Victor Trentadue manages not only 99 plus acres of his familyâs estate-owned fruit contracted to Ridge, but is also entrusted to manage 188 additional acres of Dry Creek Valley grapes under contract nearby to Draper.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

Full and complex, this wine has a nose that hints of pineapple, pears and sweet lemons. Tropical fruits are integrated with the zest of citrus fruits and give way to a creamy mid-palate. We achieved depth and complexity through a combination of winemaking methods. First, grapes were hand-picked, de-stemmed and crushed prior to undergoing cool fermentation in steel tanks and an extended maceration. A small portion of the wine was made with the traditional passito method: we dried harvested grapes on straw mats for several weeks, then gently pressed and fermented them before blending.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Trentadue La Storia Zinfandel,United States,Sonoma County,California,Zinfandel,23.99,"The Trentadue family arrived in Sonoma County long before the region gained a reputation as the Wine Country. Life-long, hands-on agriculturists, Evelyn and Leo Trentadue contributed significantly to the advancement of their region over the years. In 1959, the Trentadues decided to flee the developers encroaching on their apricot and cherry orchards in Sunnyvale, the area known today around the world as Silicon Valley. To preserve their way of life, these hard-working Italian ranchers purchased 208 acres of land in Sonoma Countyâs then remote Alexander Valley.There was little market for the regionâs dry-farmed apples, prunes, pears, and grapes in the late 1950s, so land was cheap and plentiful. Scores of ranches were for sale but, because it was blessed with an excellent combination of climate, soil, and water, Leo settled on a special piece of property in the heart of the Alexander Valley. Little did he know what this ranch had once been, much less what it was to become.The piece of land, which is now home to Trentadue Winery, has a remarkable history. In 1868, a French botanist named Andrew Bouton established Heartâs Desire Nursery on this excellent site east of the railroad tracks. With a passion for breeding new and improved strains of fruit trees, Bouton devoted himself to plant propagation, becoming a major supplier of young tree stock to orchardists throughout the western United States. His reputation attracted the attention of a young man named Luther Burbank who visited Bouton frequently. Influenced by Bouton, Burbank conducted his own work in nearby Sebastopol and Santa Rosa.Shaping the Trentadue Estate Vineyards and WineryLeo Trentadue has a reputation for openness to new ideas. Over the years, this inveterate tinkerer has been among the first to experiment with what resulted in a number of viticultural/wine industry innovations. An overview of his unheralded achievements: From dry farming to irrigation. Horse drawn plows and dry farming were still practiced when the Trentadues arrived in the Alexander Valley. Leo introduced advanced irrigation practices common to his former home in Santa Clara County.The Trentadues were among the very first to plant new vines in Sonoma County since the days of Prohibition. Italians love their red wines, especially hearty reds like Carignane. In 1962, the Trentadue family began planting new Carignane vines in addition to the 68 acres of old vines already growing on their ranch. Now more than 115 years old, these vines are among the oldest producing Carignane vineyards in America. The family remains steadfastly devoted to this grape, and their wine ranks indisputably among just a handful of top ranked California Carignane. These vines continue to provide valuable character in many of our award winning wines.Understanding the importance of growing only those grape varieties, which excelled in his vineyards, in 1974 Leo installed half-acre blocks of eight different varietals. The quality of the Sangiovese was extraordinary, so all other vines were replanted to this famed variety from Tuscany. Because Evelyn and Leo share a Tuscan heritage, it is not surprising that in 1984 Trentadue was the first producer to release a 100% varietal wine named for this famed grape of Italy. The superior quality of this fruit has produced our most popular Tasting Room wine and has been the backbone for our La Storia Cuvee 32 blend, which is consistently one of the top wines produced from the Trentadue Estate.Leo had produced an incredible, award-winning 1973 Angelica and finally, in 1987, he encouraged his winemaker to experiment with fortified wines. An excellent Petite Sirah Port resulted, among the very first of its kind. The wine was well received, so a Merlot Port and eventually a Zinfandel Port were added to the line. Over the years, Trentadue has become the leading producer of dessert wines in the area, including the wildly popular Chocolate Amore.Connection to Ridge VineyardsThis wineryâs story cannot be told without mention of the Trentaduesâ remarkable long-term relationship with Paul Draper of Ridge Vineyards. Their personal history began in 1952 when the Trentadues became Paulâs neighbor in Santa Clara, after buying an old abandoned wine estate at the end of Montebello Road. Paul began buying fruit from their ancient vines, striking up a friendship which continues to this day.Both Draper and the Trentadues know a good thing when they see it. Draper was quick to benefit from the Trentaduesâ aptitude for viticulture. The Trentadues have similarly benefited from Draperâs wine business savvy. Indeed, it is Draper who encouraged the family to take advantage of their location and establish an estate winery.The list of mutual benefits derived from the Trentadue and Ridge association is extensive: Fruit from the Trentaduesâ Geyserville estate has been sold to Ridge Vineyards every vintage since 1967. In 1974, Ridge Vineyard acquired the Trentaduesâ mountaintop winery and vineyard today known as Montebello. Victor Trentadue manages not only 99 plus acres of his familyâs estate-owned fruit contracted to Ridge, but is also entrusted to manage 188 additional acres of Dry Creek Valley grapes under contract nearby to Draper.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Duck Pond Pinot Noir Willamette Vally,United States,Willamette Valley,Oregon,Pinot Noir,19.99,"In an era of significant corporate ownership in the Northwest wine industry, our wineries and vineyards remain a close-knit family operation run by two generations of a Northwest farming family. Originally from Californiaâs Central Valley, lifelong farmers Doug and Jo Ann Fries (pronounced âFreesâ) moved their young family to the Northwest in the early 1980s. In 1984, they purchased property along the banks of the Willamette River in Dundee, Oregon, where they planted a 500-acre hazelnut orchard. As devoted wine aficionados, they also planted a small 13-acre vineyard with the hope of producing a few hundred cases of their own wine. On Memorial Day Weekend of 1993, the family opened the doors to their first winery venture, Duck Pond Cellars, in Dundee, Oregon. The tasting room was run by Doug and Jo Annâs daughter Lisa; son Greg took over winemaking after earning his enology degree from UC Davis in 1994. Over the past two decades, the family has grown the brand into one of the leading producers of Oregon Pinot Noir and Pinot Gris. The Fries family has always been passionate about full-bodied red wines such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah. This love prompted their 1992 acquisition of a 540-acre parcel of land on Eastern Washingtonâs Wahluke Slope, an area particularly suited to growing hot-climate varietals. The family dubbed the site Desert Wind Vineyard and spent three years planting Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and a handful of other varieties. In 2001, they launched the Desert Wind brand to showcase their handcrafted wines from these vineyard sites. The Desert Wind facility in Prosser, Washington, is a destination unto itself. Perched on a bluff overlooking the Yakima River, its Southwest-inspired exterior houses a tasting room, event space, restaurant area and four overnight guest rooms. Ever the hard workers, family members were very involved throughout the entire process of designing and building the facility. Today the family remains active in all winery operations. Although they say they are semi-retired, Doug and Jo Ann oversee much of the vineyard operations, often putting in long hours during the growing season. Son Greg is president of the company and oversees the winemaking team, cellar crew and vineyard workers. His wife Amber serves as director of communications, handling print and interactive media as well as the companyâs extensive charitable giving program. Vice President Lisa (Fries) Jenkins manages day-to-day winery operations. Her husband Scott is vice president of sales, spending much of his time on the road representing the familyâs wines.

The hand-picked grapes are chilled to 45(F overnight and then gently whole cluster pressed before cold settling. The machine-harvested parcels are picked when cool, early in the morning, and similarly pressed. All pressings are eliminated at this stage. The clear free-run juice is slowly cold-fermented partly with indigenous and partly with selected yeasts, and depending on the harvest, ten to twelve percent of the wine is barrel fermented with the balance vinified in stainless steel.

 Menage A Trois Silk,United States,na,California,"Pinot Noir,Malbec,Petite Sirah,Syrah",10.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the worldâs leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Marioâs son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his familyâs efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a âstuckâ fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Homeâs original philosophy to offer âa great product for a fair price,â even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

Armed with a copy of the latest Wine Spectator, founder Kevin Mehra set out on a mission to bring higher quality wine to the market for a better price. He started calling wineries with a history of high ratings to ask if they had extra wine for sale. Some told him to get lost, but in the end, he found a handful of wineries that liked his concept. The plan was simple: we put their wine in our bottle, and sell it for less.But why would wineries want to do that?You may recall that the economy wasnât in the best shape in 2009. Demand for wines priced more than $20 a bottle had plummeted and inventories were piling up. Rather than discount their wine and erode the value of their brand, we found that wineries were willing to part with a certain percentage of their production for a reduced price.It was a win/win scenario. Wineries got to sell more wine, and consumers got access to better wine at lower prices.The landscape has changed quite a bit since we launched; but our mission and our ability to offer great wine has not. With our head wine buyer, Brett Vankoski, at the helm we continue to seek out the best opportunities in the market and turn those into great values in the bottle for you. We do this because we love great wine, and we know you do too.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Coppola Diamond Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,na,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,14.97,"âIâve always been influenced by the idea of Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, which was the inspiration for ultimately all modern amusements parks. I remember the beautiful theater pavilions with the curtains painted with peacock feathers that had little ballet performances. At Tivoli, there were rides, but more important than the rides were the cafes and the refreshments, and just the sense of being in a childrenâs garden, a âpleasure gardenâ for all people to enjoy - which perhaps is the best phrase to describe what weâre creating here. This vision was replicated at places on Coney Island, like Luna Park, and George C. Tilyouâs Steeplechase Park, or Palisades Park. These were basically wonderlands, and I thought Francis Ford Coppola Winery could become such a park for the family to go and enjoy, where there are things for kids to do, so they can be close to their parents who are sampling wines and foods.Iâve often felt that modern life tends to separate all the ages too much. In the old days, the children lived with the parents and the grandparents, and the family unit each gave one another something very valuable. So when we began to develop the idea for this winery, we thought it should be like a resort, basically a wine wonderland, a park of pleasure where people of all ages can enjoy the best things in life - food, wine, music, dancing, games, swimming and performances of all types. A place to celebrate the love of life.â- Francis Ford CoppolaFor more than thirty years, we have been committed to environmentally responsible business practices. Itâs been our goal to minimize our impact on the environment by seeking out innovative ways to produce and package our goods.At Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all 24 planted acres are sustainably farmed and part of the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program. We try to purchase fruit from growers who farm sustainably, and some of the vineyards we source from are certified organic as well. Another benefit of participating in the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program is that we have subsequently become a learning-teaching vineyard. Every technique we implement is thoroughly documented so that we, and neighboring Sonoma winegrowers, can pinpoint the best ways to protect our land and craft the best wines from these vineyards.We are also actively involved in the Fish Friendly Farming certification program. While this may seem like a matter totally unrelated to wine, watershed quality management is intrinsically connected to farming our vineyard because our property includes two blue-line creeks. These creeks are a part of the Russian River watershed that supports steelhead trout and Coho salmon populations. In conjunction with our neighbors and local, state, and federal agencies, we work diligently to promote the overall health of the Russian River watershed so that the entire ecosystem remains in balance and is preserved for generations to come.Our winegrowing practices involve the Integrated Pest Management program, which discusses the best practices for maintaining soil and vine health and proactively farming to reduce and treat pest pressures. Field experts provide monthly lectures concerning pest problems and solutions which we implement in our vineyard. Through our integrated pest management program, we have complemented the biodiversity of our vineyard by promoting the presence of beneficial insects, soil fauna, and owls that combat pests of grapevines.Finally, we recycle our grape and water waste by fertilizing with composted grape pomace and irrigating only with reclaimed winery wastewater.  In effect, we have closed the loop on our waste system in an effort to reduce our carbon footprint on the land we so love.Outside of the vineyard, our Francis Coppola Diamond Collection wines are packaged in 100% recycled cardboard case boxes, and all of the corks we purchase come from sustainable cork forests. Additionally, we insist that the label and foil companies we do business with have environmentally friendly practices as well.During the reconstruction of Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all of the crews, vendors, and sub-contractors we hired were local residents, helping to cut down on transportation costs, as well as supporting the economy of our community.Rather than use new lumber for the construction, we reused the wood from the Redwood trees that were removed from the courtyard area. Some of this timber was used to build the main reception desk in the Guest Services building, while other portions has been used to build the outdoor dining tables. The pyramid skylights in our towers feature an environmentally friendly material called Kalwall to construct skylights. This material diffuses light in such a way that little artificial lighting is needed, which helps conserve energy.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

After the fruit was harvested and brought to the winery, it was allowed a three-day cold soak, which prevented the onset of fermentation and allowed the gentle extraction of bright fruit flavors and dark colors. We then fermented the wine in stainless steel tanks, incorporating the skins and juice with regular pump-over. To knit together the flavors and impart complexity and structure, we barrel aged the wine for seven months.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"
 Senor Sangria Red,United States,Hudson Valley,New York,Non-Varietal Red Blend,8.99,"In 1810, a French Huguenot emigre named Jean Jaques purchased land in New Yorkâs bucolic Hudson Valley and began planting grapes. By 1837, Mr. Jaques needed more land, so he purchased a plot in the quiet village of Washingtonville, NY, and planted another vineyard. By 1839, his first underground cellars were dug and Mr. Jaques fermented his first wine vintage. Those cellars, the oldest and largest in America, are still in use today at Brotherhood Winery.The Jaques family made wine at the Washingtonville facility for almost 60 years, selling much of it to Jesse and Edward Emerson, two New York City wine merchants. The Emersons, Finger Lakes vinters themselves, understood the high quality of Mr. Jaquesâ wine and used it to improve a blend of wine from an organization called The Brotherhood of New Life - an experiment in utopian communal living in the Hudson Valley. When the Emerson family took control of the Washingtonville winery, they renamed it Brotherhood, a name that it still proudly bears today.The Emerson family operated Brotherhood until Prohibition. In 1921, Louis Farrell purchased the winery and its large stock of sacramental wine. He sold wine for religious ceremonies throughout Prohibition, which was finally repealed in 1933. It has been noted that the clergy population in the area grew substantially during this period.Louis and his wife were the first to grasp the value of Brotherhoodâs location, as the nearest winery to New York City. They began conducting tours of the winery, highlighting the now-enlarged underground cellars, the history of the facility and its picturesque site. In fact, the Farrell family initiated the very concept of wine tourism, hosting parties and events at the winery that drew hundreds of thousands of fans annually, and introduced the Brotherhood brand to generations of American drinkers.A partnership of businessmen purchased the winery in 1987, including a prominent winemaker from Chile, Mr. Cesar Baeza. Baeza, internationally recognized as a master blender, wine educator and winery consultant, set about creating premium New York varietal wines and converting Brotherhood into a premier destination in NY State.After a disastrous fire in 1999, Brotherhoodâs fortunes suffered until 2005, when Mr. Baeza formed a new partnership with two winemaking families from Chile. The Castro and Chadwick families have deep roots in the famous winegrowing areas of the Maule Valley, near San Clemente, where they farm hundreds of acres of Vinifera grapes, along with other fruit.The new Board of Directors has embarked on a massive restoration and renovation program at Brotherhood that includes equipment upgrades, vineyard acquisitions, the planting of new vines and a facility remodeling, highlighting the partnersâ commitment to improving quality.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

An unheated loggerâs cabin on 49 acres would serve as home â and ad hoc winery â for several years.The following spring, he planted the Dundee Hillâs first wine grapes â 23 varieties. Pinot Noir flourished.By 1972, Erath had produced his first commercial wine of 216 cases â the first official wine production in the Dundee Hills. Enchanted with French varietals, he soon began testing non-California clones and was instrumental in importing French clones to Oregon in 1974.In 1976, Erath broke ground on the first winery in the Dundee Hills. Early successes, including the 1982 Pinot Noir vintage, inspired leading winemakers to move to Oregon to forge their own path in this special place.Disciplined in approach yet progressive in artistry, our winemaker Gary Horner, strives to reveal classic Oregon Pinot: light, delicate and fruit-forward.Garyâs goal of âmaking the best Pinot Noir the region has to offer â time honored, authentic and uniquely Oregonâ is matched by his reputation of excellence.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

Some people think it goes back to the 1930s and the origins of commercial winemaking in California, when people would gather for a grape stomp and carry the fresh juice home. Others think itâs all about the convenience of the ring, the simple loop that makes it easy to carry, pour and share your favorite wine. It may be a little bit of both, but we like to think itâs just another way Carlo made his wines stand out from the crowd.Today, Carlo Rossi serves up 12 wines in its now iconic jug that continue to be sensibly priced and easy to enjoy with family and friends.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

Cantine Leonardo is situated in the borough of Vinci, just five kilometres from the birthplace of the world famous artist and inventor Leonardo.The co-operative takes its name from the great man, paying homage to the mind of the man who was universally recognised as a genius and to emphasise its deep-rooted bond with the territory, the same bond which Leonardo felt and whose surname is specifically associated with the village where he was born on 15 April 1452.Today, Cantine Leonardo da Vinci is a pioneering co-operative, innovative and modern, which relies on the work and grape production of its 160 members.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"
 Silverado Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Napa County,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,49.99,"âThe beginning of vine planting is like the beginning of mining for precious metals: the winegrower also âprospectsâ.â - Robert Louis Stevenson, The Silverado Squatters, 1880A century later, the Miller family began the journey Stevenson described, establishing Silverado Vineyards in 1981. âIt was beautiful land, and it was land that was working,â says Diane Miller of their first vineyards, purchased in the 1970s. Diane and Ron sold their grapes to some of Napaâs best vintners, who made award winning wines from them year after year. Encouraged, they struck out on their own with the goal of making the best wines the estate could produce at a fair price. This has remained the guiding philosophy over the years. The wineryâs name, Silverado, comes from the abandoned mining town at the top of the Napa Valley, where Stevenson stayed so many years ago.

 Baron Herzog White Zinfandel,United States,na,California,Zinfandel,8.99,"The Jewish people have a special relationship to wine that predates even the Romans and Greeks. For the ancient Jews, whose temple in Jerusalem was renowned throughout the fledgling civilizations of the Middle East, wine played an important role in religious ritual. Today, thousands of years later, it continues to do so. Kiddush, the prayer over the wine, traditionally announces the beginning of the Sabbath on Friday night as well as other holidays.And so it should come as no surprise that the Herzog family has been making wine for a long time. They trace their winemaking origins back to Philip Herzog, who made wine in Slovakia for the Austro-Hungarian court more than a century ago. Philipâs wines were so appreciated by Emperor Franz-Josef, that the emperor made Philip a baron. The Baron Herzog wines-a line of premium yet moderately priced California varietals-are named to commemorate the honor.Baron Philip made both kosher and non-kosher wines. The kosher wines were made in a separate cellar and tasted remarkably like his non-kosher wines. Indeed, the wines were made in the same basic manner. However, the kosher wines required a Jewish, Sabbath-observant cellar crew.During World War II, Philipâs grandson Eugene hid his family from the Nazis by moving them around the Slovakian countryside. After the warâs end, he emerged from behind a false wall in a courageous Christian friendâs woodshed to reclaim his familyâs winery.But three years later, the new Czech communist regime drove the Herzogs away from their European home for good. Forced to leave with little more than the clothes on their backs, the family said goodbye to their former royal economic and social stature.Eugene brought the family to America in 1948 after the Holocaust.  He arrived in New York City with his wife, Sidonia, six of his own children and two additional war orphans. They moved to the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn with only enough money to rent a two-bedroom tenement flat. With his winemaking skills, Eugene found a job at a small kosher winery tucked away into a storefront on Manhattanâs Lower East Side. For a paltry salary, he made sweet, Concord-grape wines in the cellar. (European grape varieties for dry wines were not easy to obtain in post World War II New York.) He also drove the wine delivery truck. But because the company was so poor, he was paid for his driving acumen in company shares, not cash.For years the shares were worthless, but by 1958, all the other shareholders had given up their shares. They assumed the business was doomed to failure. Eugene and his sons, who all went to work at the winery, proved them wrong. They called their new venture Royal Wines, in deference to their grandfather, Philip.In 1985, the Herzog family decided to expand their winemaking operations to California, where they make wine under two separate labels: Baron Herzog and Herzog Wine Cellars. After twenty years of renting space in various wineries, the family was finally able to build its own state-of-the-art winery just south of Santa Barbara, in the town of Oxnard. Here, under the supervision of head winemaker Joe Hurliman, Herzog Wine Cellars has created a center for high-end contemporary winemaking in a tradition that dates back nearly six centuries.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Vampire Pinot Noir,United States,na,California,Pinot Noir,9.99,"The year was 1985, and it was pitch dark on a rural highway somewhere in the Nevada desert.  The only visible lights were the stars up above, when Michael Machat first saw the vision  across the sky.  The image was red wine, and the name was Vampire. Some 3000 miles later Machat emerged in NY eager to share what, he thought, was a brilliant idea.  Unfortunately the reaction from the wine trade was  disbelief.  âA wine named Vampire?  What was this young New York lawyer thinking?â At that time the notion of calling a  wine VampireÂ®, let alone describing it as the Blood of the Vine!Â® was downright silly if not irreverent.  Wine was meant to be taken seriously; it wasnât meant for playing games.Not perturbed by the skeptics, the idea stayed with him.   Transylvania was the logical choice, but at the time it was ruled by the communist dictator Ceausescu, and marketing was illegal.   They too werenât interested in Machatâs ideas.  But the power of the vision stayed with him.Later that year music/trademark attorney, Michael Machat, visited  London for what was supposed to be a four week business trip.  It was here that he met the girl who would become the future Countess to Vampire wines, and his wife to this day - British beauty musician/writer Lisa Dominique.  Michaelâs one month stay in England lasted 7 years and in 1990, Michael married English rock star Lisa Dominique.While representing artists in England, Machat didnât give up on his vision.   Since Transylvania wasnât an option, he began elsewhere.  In 1988, while living in London, he released the first Vampire wine, a full bodied Algerian Syrah bottled in France.   Next was an Italian Sangiovese, which found its way back home to the Anne Rice Fan Club in New Orleans.It wasnât until 1990 when the Berlin Wall was torn down and the Romanian people executed their leader that Michael began his early trips to Transylvania seeking a winery for his concept. It wasnât easy. Marketing had been unlawful for 45 years and the Romanians had no appreciation for the western worldâs notion of a vampire. Many vintners were too proud to allow Machat to brand their wine as he envisioned. They had a different understanding of vampires, and convincing them that the idea would work was surprisingly not simple.In 1995, one decade after that road trip, Michael brought his  vision to life. He had at long last found a home for his idea in Transylvania.  From the soil and roots of the legendary Count Dracula, Vampire had arisen and the true blood of the vine was born.Over two decades have passed since that first production of Vampire wine in Transylvania, and we are proud to say it has been a wonderful journey of making our wines the best that they can be.  Along the way, both Michael and Lisaâs palates matured. They began demanding better and better wine for their Vampire Brand.So in 2007, the Machat family uprooted their connections in Transylvania and moved their wine production to California where they reside. The first California production was produced in Paso Robles. The following year the Machats began expanding the Vampire range, adding  Dracula and Trueblood to their upper range of wines.With an unyielding thirst for even more distinctive and sophisticated wines, the Machats established a winery up in Napa where they produce Cabernet Sauvignon,  Pinot Noir, and Chardonnay. In May 2014, their Trueblood Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon won a Gold Medal and scored 90 Points at the Los Angeles International Wine and Spirits Competition.In 2011 the Countess Lisa Dominique designed and opened up the Vampire Lounge & Tasting Room in Beverly Hills.  The venue has become a favorite of many to hang out and relax over a glass of wine.  (The staff are discreet as would be expected in a place haunted by entertainment personalities. )n 2014, the Countess Lisa also proudly released her first Vampire novel, âA Walk in the Sunâ - a Vampire Vineyards publication.  The book has garnered great reviews and has been compared to the classic Bram Stokerâs Dracula by Kirkus Reviews.Whatever the Machat âVampire Vineyardsâ Family share and produce, they surround it with a passion that reveals their love for what they do.  Be it their range of award winning wines, their delicious fine Vampire Belgian chocolates or their eclectic Vampire Coffees, or maybe just a cozy night by the fire reading âA Walk in the Sunâ whilst sipping the blood of the Vine!  Itâs what they love to do.  It is their passion, and that passion is something they feel blessed to be able to share with you.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Cakebread Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Napa County,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,69.99,"The grapes are hand harvested, destemmed and immediately crushed, and each vineyard lot is fermented separately with selected yeasts in temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks over a period of six to seven days. Each lot of grapes is frequently tasted during fermentation to determine when the extraction is at optimum. At that point, the wine is pressed off the skins in membrane wine presses, keeping the press wine separate from the free-run wine. In this way, Cakebread Cellars' red wines, especially the Cabernets, have their natural fruitiness preserved, while the extraction of harsh, drying tannins is avoided. It is then pressed and returned to stainless steel for complete malolactic fermentation. Following this, the wine is racked into French oak barrels, of which roughly half are new and half of one and two years' use for approximately six months.Throughout the initial aging process, the various individual lots are continually taste-analyzed to determine the final blend. Depending on the vintage, the finished blend will include up to twenty five percent combined Merlot and Cabernet Franc, with Merlot contributing the greater percentage. Once the final blend is assembled, it is returned to the same French oak barrels to age for an additional 12 to 18 months before being bottled.

With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the worldâs leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Marioâs son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his familyâs efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a âstuckâ fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Homeâs original philosophy to offer âa great product for a fair price,â even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley.

 Bread & Butter Chardonnay,United States,na,California,Chardonnay,11.99,"This is the BREAD.The use of wood barrels for wine began thousands of years ago for storage purposes, replacing clay vessels. Wood barrels were stronger and easier to move, but originally, they did not have a specific winemaking role.  Over time, it became apparent that aging wine in wood produced positive effects in the flavor, texture, and aroma of wine. Today, oak treatment is one of the most important tools in the winemaking process.Aging wine in oak barrels allows for moderate oxidation and evaporation of the wine, which lowers astringency and increases complexity and concentration in the wine. The complex chemical compounds in oak wood impart flavors and aromas to the wine that include toast, vanilla, tea, and nuttiness. These are flavors that we connect with bread or baked goods, like pie crust and biscuits.  If you can imagine the difference between a spoon full of jam vs. that same jam spread over a warm slice of toast, you can imagine how oak flavors and aromas can enhance the experience of a wine.Oak sources can be as specific as coming from a particular forest, but in general, we look to French oak for silkier textures and spicier characters.  Eastern European countries such as Hungary, Croatia, and Russia offer similar varieties of oak, but each source offers different results of spice, nuttiness, texture in the wine. We look to American oak for stronger influences of vanilla and coconut with creamier textures.  Bread & Butter Chardonnay and Pinot Noir are aged in a combination of French, American, and East European oak, ranging from new to 4 years old. We also utilize multiple cooperages, typically at a medium toast level, but continue to experiment with different oak sources, treatments, and technologies. Our goal is to continually improve enjoyment while maintaining an accessible price for our customers.  Much like a spice rack, the age of the oak, the type of oak, the level of toasting, the cooper, and even the way the wood was harvested or cut has an effect on the flavors and aromas in the wine.  None of that matters though if the wine is not delicious for the price that one pays, so as with all things, balance is the objective.Bread & Butter Riesling does not see any oak.This is the BUTTER.Malolactic fermentation, or MLF, is the process by which we convert malic acid to lactic acid. The process increases stability of the wine but it also takes harsh, tart malic acid (think green apples) and converts it to softer, richer lactic acid (think cream and butter).  The determining factors in buttery character are directly related to 3 key factors: type, temperature, and timing.Type: While some grapes are more likely to have naturally higher levels of malic acid, the type of climate in which they are grown is a stronger determining factor.  Grapes grown in cooler climates tend to have considerably higher levels of malic acid, while grapes grown in warmer climates have lower levels. Through the process of MFL, the amount of lactic acid produced is about half the amount of malic acid with which it began. For instance, if you start with 4 g/l of malic acid, after 100% MFL, the wine will have roughly 2 g/l of lactic acid.  A higher level of malic acid should convert to more lactic acid, thus producing more butter flavors and aromas.Temperature:  Similarly, the temperature at which we ferment the grapes will also affect the amount of buttery character in the wine. A higher temperature will produce less buttery character, while a cold fermentation will add a lot of butter flavor and aroma.Timing: When MFL is introduced has a major bearing on itâs effects on the wine.  The introduction of MFL during the primary fermentation of a wine will decrease the buttery character.  This is because the yeast that is feeding on sugar, starts feeding on the lactic acid that is being produced, which decreasing the lactic acid levels in the finished wine.  If that same wine undergoes MFL after the primary fermentation will have a higher level of lactic acid, and thus increased buttery characters.Bread & Butter Chardonnay and Pinot Noir are examples of wines that benefited from cool climate growing regions, cold fermentations, and post-primary fermentation MLF. Thus our wines present very smooth and rich, without harsh acids or sharp textures.  Bread & Butter Riesling sees no malolactic fermentation, but acid levels are balanced with sugar.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Charles Smith Kungfu Girl Riesling,United States,na,Washington,Riesling,9.97,"Growing up just outside of Sacramento, California, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Charles Smith began craving worldly travel at a young age due to his Welsh mother and French father. As soon as he had the chance, Charles decided to move to Denmark (for a âhot piece of a** i.e. a lady friend he met in the states). While in Scandinavia, Charles spent the next nine years managing rock bands and concert tours throughout Europe, including the famed Danish duo, The Ravonettes. Wining and dining while on the road became a catalyst for his passion of wine, which ultimately triggered the career he has today.In 1999, he moved back to the United States, specifically to the Pacific Northwest, opening a wine shop on Bainbridge Island, just across the Puget Sound from downtown Seattle. On a road trip in late 1999, he passed through the small town of Walla Walla and met a young Frenchman and winemaker. The two men discovered their common passion for great Syrah and Charles was eventually convinced to move to Walla Walla and make his own juice. In 2001, Charles released 330 cases of his first wine, the 1999 K Syrah. The Walla Walla Valley was now his home.After a devastating freeze in 2004, Charles brought to life a label he had once in a dream: House Wine. Low and behold, the label concept had never been created or trademarked, so Charles launched the legendary brand before selling it to Precept Brands in 2006. That same year, Charles started a second brand, Charles Smith Wines. The brand was themed as âThe Modernist Project, which focuses on the way people generally consume wine today: immediately. The intent was (and still is) to create wines to be enjoyed now, but with true typicity of both the varietal and the vineyard.A self-taught winemaker, Charles is a true artisan and a pioneer in the wine world. In 2008, K Vintners was recognized by Wine & Spirits magazine as one of the âBest New Wineries of the Last Ten Years, and as âWinery of the Year in their annual buying guide. In 2009 Food & Wine magazine awarded Charles âWinemaker of the Year and in 2010 Seattle Magazine recognized Charles as their âWinemaker of the Year.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

The terroir is apparently homogeneous but itâs actually geologically very diverse as the Dentelles de Montmirail makes it very complicated. Saint Cosme is exceptionally located at the crossing of two geological faults, which is very rare. This gives us an extraordinary diversity of soils. Our microclimate is cool and late ripening. Our Gigondas have the ability to be powerful and refined at the same time. The Saint Cosmeâs Chapel, located in the heart of our vineyard is a pure example of roman art. It was built at the XI and XII century. Purity, balance and beauty: the Chapel is a witness of the medieval times and it gives an intense and special atmosphere to our vineyard.

During my various travels and tastings in the RhÃ´ne Valley, I often thought that many great terroirs were under-exploited. I really liked some locations and I wanted to try. My wish was to become a negociant which would work with the spirit of a vigneron using ancient methods. This was meaning: being and remaining a small producer, be followed by winemakers having the same ambition, transport my wines in casks to avoid to rack them and kill their fruit, trying to do only nice things every day.At Saint Cosme we usually work ""Ã  la mainâ.

 Ramirez de la Piscina Rioja Crianza,Spain,Rioja Alta,Rioja,Tempranillo,12.99,"Vineyards:At least 25 years old. Located in Abalos and San Vicente de la Sonsierra, Rioja Alta. Clay and Limestone soil.Vinification: Bunches are carefully sorted on the selection table, and then destemmed and transferred to a tank for skin-contact maceration. After several days, tumultuous fermentation starts in the liquid found underneath the cap of skins floating on the surface. Automatic pumping-over and punching-down allow the tannins and colour to be extracted from the grape skins. The entire fermentation is temperature-controlled in order to favour the survival of the yeasts until the end of the process. When fermentation finishes, the wine is run off by gravity.This method of destemming ensures a greater concentration of polyphenols and colour, which will be absolutely vital for the wineâs ageing in barrel.Ageing: After alcoholic and malolactic fermentation, the wine is racked into 225 litre American and French oak barrels where it spends 15 months ageing in our bodegaâs underground cellars.Thereafter the wine is transferred back to the tanks for 5 months of natural fining and settling before filtering and bottling.Ageing is completed in the bottle.

 Coppola Directors Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Sonoma County,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,17.97,"âIâve always been influenced by the idea of Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, which was the inspiration for ultimately all modern amusements parks. I remember the beautiful theater pavilions with the curtains painted with peacock feathers that had little ballet performances. At Tivoli, there were rides, but more important than the rides were the cafes and the refreshments, and just the sense of being in a childrenâs garden, a âpleasure gardenâ for all people to enjoy - which perhaps is the best phrase to describe what weâre creating here. This vision was replicated at places on Coney Island, like Luna Park, and George C. Tilyouâs Steeplechase Park, or Palisades Park. These were basically wonderlands, and I thought Francis Ford Coppola Winery could become such a park for the family to go and enjoy, where there are things for kids to do, so they can be close to their parents who are sampling wines and foods.Iâve often felt that modern life tends to separate all the ages too much. In the old days, the children lived with the parents and the grandparents, and the family unit each gave one another something very valuable. So when we began to develop the idea for this winery, we thought it should be like a resort, basically a wine wonderland, a park of pleasure where people of all ages can enjoy the best things in life - food, wine, music, dancing, games, swimming and performances of all types. A place to celebrate the love of life.â- Francis Ford CoppolaFor more than thirty years, we have been committed to environmentally responsible business practices. Itâs been our goal to minimize our impact on the environment by seeking out innovative ways to produce and package our goods.At Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all 24 planted acres are sustainably farmed and part of the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program. We try to purchase fruit from growers who farm sustainably, and some of the vineyards we source from are certified organic as well. Another benefit of participating in the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program is that we have subsequently become a learning-teaching vineyard. Every technique we implement is thoroughly documented so that we, and neighboring Sonoma winegrowers, can pinpoint the best ways to protect our land and craft the best wines from these vineyards.We are also actively involved in the Fish Friendly Farming certification program. While this may seem like a matter totally unrelated to wine, watershed quality management is intrinsically connected to farming our vineyard because our property includes two blue-line creeks. These creeks are a part of the Russian River watershed that supports steelhead trout and Coho salmon populations. In conjunction with our neighbors and local, state, and federal agencies, we work diligently to promote the overall health of the Russian River watershed so that the entire ecosystem remains in balance and is preserved for generations to come.Our winegrowing practices involve the Integrated Pest Management program, which discusses the best practices for maintaining soil and vine health and proactively farming to reduce and treat pest pressures. Field experts provide monthly lectures concerning pest problems and solutions which we implement in our vineyard. Through our integrated pest management program, we have complemented the biodiversity of our vineyard by promoting the presence of beneficial insects, soil fauna, and owls that combat pests of grapevines.Finally, we recycle our grape and water waste by fertilizing with composted grape pomace and irrigating only with reclaimed winery wastewater.  In effect, we have closed the loop on our waste system in an effort to reduce our carbon footprint on the land we so love.Outside of the vineyard, our Francis Coppola Diamond Collection wines are packaged in 100% recycled cardboard case boxes, and all of the corks we purchase come from sustainable cork forests. Additionally, we insist that the label and foil companies we do business with have environmentally friendly practices as well.During the reconstruction of Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all of the crews, vendors, and sub-contractors we hired were local residents, helping to cut down on transportation costs, as well as supporting the economy of our community.Rather than use new lumber for the construction, we reused the wood from the Redwood trees that were removed from the courtyard area. Some of this timber was used to build the main reception desk in the Guest Services building, while other portions has been used to build the outdoor dining tables. The pyramid skylights in our towers feature an environmentally friendly material called Kalwall to construct skylights. This material diffuses light in such a way that little artificial lighting is needed, which helps conserve energy.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Averaen Willamette Valley Pinot Noir,United States,Willamette Valley,Oregon,Pinot Noir,19.99,"The seed for AVERÃN was planted when we (Baron, Noah & Steve from Banshee Wines in Sonoma) attended IPNC in the Willamette Valley three years ago.  There we were, sitting around a campfire, in what is now a vineyard that weâre sourcing 10 tons of Pinot Noir from this harvest, talking about the similarities between our cold and foggy Sonoma Coast and the various sub-appellations of the Willamette Valley.  From the cold wind that funnels from the Pacific Ocean through low-lying gaps in the coastal mountain ranges (the Van Duzer Corridor in Oregon and the Petaluma Wind Gap in Sonoma), to the mix of marine sedimentary and volcanic influenced soils that play off of one another to create the micro-terroirs of each appellation.  The similarities were shocking.  What got us really excited was that we saw the potential to make wine at the very highest level, using what were considered at the time to be the very top vineyard sites, all at a cost that was considerably less that what we were experiencing in the Sonoma Coast.  Oregon reminded us of where the Sonoma Coast was 10-15 years ago.  Still finding its way in terms of consistency, but when done right, way over-delivering.  The quality was there in a big way, but the prices were still so reasonable.As fate would have it, we reconnected with our friend and winemaker Adam Smith, who made the very first vintage of Banshee Wines in California for us.  Adam moved to Oregon in 2010 and has made wine at Shea Cellars, Domaine Serene, and has made all three vintages of the highly sought-after new project from Meo-Camuzet.

In 1995, the brand image underwent its first change. The wine maintains the same quality as always, the bottle remains unchanged, but a new, more stylish label was introduced bearing a simple colour arrangement, dominated by green. The lettering became more legible and created more impact.

Always focusing on innovation and the creation of strong brands, in 2004 Sogrape Vinhos decided to relaunch and reposition Gazela, aiming to modernise and streamline the Vinho Verde category and assume its leadership.

 Domaine des Billards Saint-Amour,France,Beaujolais,Burgundy,Gamay,17.99,"In 1821 the mayor of Chenas, Jean-Marie Loron, began exporting the wines Beaujolais and Macon around the world. After taking over the business some years later, Jean-Marieâs son married one of the daughters of the Charlet family in 1852. Her family owned the Clos de Billards vineyard in Saint Amour and, following the marriage, the two businesses merged. By the 1900âs the Loron family was one of the most famous negotiants in Beaujolais, with holdings in almost all of the famous crus. Unlike other negotiants, however, the individual domaines continued to produce their wine independently using the traditional methods they always had. Six generations later, this venerable family is still firmly rooted in the region and still producing outstanding Beaujolais. The wines are made by Xavier and Gregory Barbet, direct decedents of the original owners, and are labeled under the Barbet name.This is seriously old-school winemaking: after hand-harvesting, the grapes undergo semi-carbonic maceration in vats using only indigenous yeasts. The wines are then aged half in cement tanks and half in large old wooden foudres with a light fining before bottling. Although delicious when young, the wines are incredibly age-worthy. A recent tasting of wines ranging back into the mid-1970âs showed great intensity and complexity without any sign of fatigue.The Beaujolais region is finally getting the recognition it deserves and the Barbets are a perfect example of why; these are impressive wines with surprising complexity and elegance. They would not be out of place in any collectorâs cellar nor on the table with your next meal.

 Dows Late Bottle Vintage,Portugal,Douro - Porto,Duriense,Port Blend,24.99,"Whilst the majority of Port is now made with modern methods using state-of-the-art vinification technology, a small proportion is still produced by the time-honoured method of treading. In either system, fermentations are relatively short (two to three days) because Port is a fortified wine. Fortification, which involves the addition of natural grape spirit to the fermenting juice, intentionally interrupts the fermentation process at a point when approximately half of the grapesâ natural sugar has been converted into alcohol. This accounts for Portâs characteristic rich, luscious style and also contributes to the wineâs considerable ageing potential. Given the short fermentation cycle it is crucial to extract as much flavour, colour and tannins as possible from the grape skins.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"
 Produttori del Barbaresco,Italy,Barbaresco,Piedmont,Nebbiolo,39.99,"Prior to 1894, Nebbiolo grapes were sold to make Barolo wine or simply labeled âNebbiolo di Barbarescoâ. But in 1894, Domizio Cavazza, headmaster of the Royal Enological School of Alba and a Barbaresco resident, created the first cooperative, the âCantine Socialiâ, by gathering together nine Barbaresco vineyard owners to make wine in the local castle that he owned. Cavazza understood that there were differences between Nebbiolo grapes grown in the Barolo district versus the same grapes grown in the Barbaresco district and, for the first time, recognized it on the wine label. The âCantine Socialiâ was forced to close in the 1920âS because of fascist economic rules. In 1958, the priest of the village of Barbaresco, recognizing that the only way the small properties could survive was by joining their efforts, gathered together nineteen small growers and founded the Produttori del Barbaresco. The first three vintages were made in the church basement, and then in the winery built across the square from where the Produttori is still located. United once again, the small growers continued the work started by Domizio Cavazza, producing only Barbaresco wine and enhancing both the reputation of the wine and the village. The proud past of Barbaresco and the dedication of its creators have made the Produttori one of the greatest producers in a great wine-producing area; it... âcontinues to set some of the highest standards of wine making for any cooperative in the worldâ. (Robert M. Parker, Jr.; The Wine Advocate, 2-28-90). The Produttori del Barbaresco, founded in 1958, now has 56 members and 100 hectares (250 acres) of Nebbiolo vineyards in the Barbaresco appellation, which amounts to almost 1/6 of the vineyards of the area.Each family is in full control of its land, growing Nebbiolo grapes with centuries old skill and dedication. The winery produces a Barbaresco D.O.C.G., a blend of Nebbiolo grapes harvested from different vineyards, and a simpler Nebbiolo Langhe suited for earlier consumption. In great vintages, nine single-vineyard Barbarescos are produced from nine classic premium sites within the Barbaresco village boundaries: Asili, Rabaja, Pora, Montestefano, Ovello, Paje, Montefico, Moccagatta and Rio Sordo. These are the geographical names of sites where Nebbiolo grapes have always been cultivated. The names of the single-vineyards, the total number of bottles produced, and the name of the owners of the vineyards are marked on the labels. The Produttori del Barbaresco, which vinifies only Nebbiolo grapes, produces around 420,000 bottles (35,000 cases) per year. In a good vintage they are divided among Barbaresco (40%), single vineyard Barbarescos (40%) and Nebbiolo Langhe (20%).

 Landmark Chardonnay Overlook,United States,na,California,Chardonnay,19.99,"We believe wine is an essential part of gracious living and Landmark enhances the experience of every meal and social gathering.The success of Landmark Vineyards began in the heartland of America in 1838. It began when John Deere invented the steel plow and unearthed Americaâs agricultural abundance.That commitment to innovative means of production and respect for the land, and what the land had to offer, moved like a DNA chromosome from one generation to another until it found another challenge in the soil of California, Sonoma County, wine country: Landmark Vineyards.Landmark Vineyards was originally founded in Windsor, Sonoma County in 1974. It was a small family winery that was slowly being smothered by urban sprawl. But the facility was saved in 1989, when Damaris Deere Ethridge. the great, great, granddaughter of John Deere, visited wine country with a vision. Like her ancestor, she wanted to reunite herself and her family with the soil.Damaris believed Landmark could be a small jewel of a winery, producing limited amounts of the worldâs finest Chardonnay. She purchased Landmark and relocated the facility from Windsor to Kenwood. She built a winery combining a traditional Spanish mission style exterior with a bright contemporary interior equipped with the state-of-the-art winemaking equipment. It was a blend of old and new, of what the land knew and the promise it offered. Having a clear vision for the future, her next step was to fill it with people who would execute her plans. She started by convincing her son, Michael Deere Colhoun and his wife Mary, to move from the east coast and join her as partners in the winery.Once settled, the Colhouns set in motion a plan that would truly make the winery a landmark. In 1993, they hired the world-renowned consulting enologist Helen Turly to work with Eric Stern, Landmarkâs winemaker. Eric has the distinction of being the only winemaker in the world to have attended the Julliard School of Music; however, he had a calling to switch muses -from Orpheus to Bacchus. Like a skilled musician, Eric took the notes he had been given and created a great fugue, bringing together grapes from selected diverse vineyards, innovative and traditional techniques, and French oak to produce an opulent and elegant wine that made the name Landmark synonymous with âsuper premiumâ Chardonnay.This winery remains one of the best kept secrets for outstanding Chardonnays as well as increasingly sumptuous Pinot Noirs.Rober M. Parker, Jr, The Wine Advocate, Issue 132As the Chardonnay has gained reputation and prominence in the marketplace, Pinot Noir became an additional focus and passion for the Landmark team. With the strong belief that vineyards and terroir make great wine, Landmarkâs limited Pinot Noir is making a mark in the world of wine.Our story is about soil, innovation and dedication: a legacy that has been passed down through Deere generations for 162 years. We seek to make the best wine possible because we live in the best possible place on Earth.

 Quady Essencia Muscat,United States,na,California,Muscat Blanc A Petits Grains,21.99,"First there were two â Andrew and Laurel Quady left crowded southern California and their jobs in pyrotechnics and merchandising to pursue their dream: a non-urban way of life making wine. Returning to school, Andrew graduated with a Masters in Food Science-Enology from UC Davis and Laurel became a licensed CPA. In 1975, at the urging of friend Darrell Corti, they made their first port from Amador County Zinfandel in Lodi. In 1977, settled in Madera in Californiaâs San Joaquin Valley with Andrew working at a nearby winery, they built their own small winery behind their country home and made port on evenings and weekends. In 1980 they made a fortified dessert wine from the obscure Orange Muscat grape variety. The wine, Essensia, was unlike anything in the dessert wine field and became a major success. In 1983, opportunity knocked when they were offered a crop of Black Muscat grapes that became Elysium, the first dessert wine to smell of roses.Then there were four â By 1982 the expanding business needed space and Andrew and Laurel needed help. While still working on his winemaking degree at Fresno State, now winemaker Michael Blaylock moonlighted evenings during crush. Michael became Quadyâs full time winemaker in 1984 and never looked back. Quadyâs continued rise and recognition across the industry for extremely high quality is due to Michaelâs exacting standards from the vineyard to the bottle. Cheryl Russell, Quadyâs general manager also joined full time in 1984, and the dedicated team worked together to achieve consistent success. With their enthusiasm and integrity the winery continued to grow, developing more unique wines: Starboard (our euphemism for port), Electra (white and red) and Vya vermouth. For more about Quadyâs winemaker, Michael Blaylock, and general manager, Cheryl Russell, click here.Now there are more â Many of the Quady Winery staff have been with the winery for over twenty years. Production Manager Danny Mejia started in 1985 and Cellar Master Mauro Molina in 1988. Since then, the staff has grown to include assistant winemaker Darin Peterson, six full time cellar employees, five office staff, and several part-time employees.

Some people think it goes back to the 1930s and the origins of commercial winemaking in California, when people would gather for a grape stomp and carry the fresh juice home. Others think itâs all about the convenience of the ring, the simple loop that makes it easy to carry, pour and share your favorite wine.

 Coppola Diamond Pinot Grigo,United States,na,California,Pinot Gris,12.99,"âIâve always been influenced by the idea of Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, which was the inspiration for ultimately all modern amusements parks. I remember the beautiful theater pavilions with the curtains painted with peacock feathers that had little ballet performances. At Tivoli, there were rides, but more important than the rides were the cafes and the refreshments, and just the sense of being in a childrenâs garden, a âpleasure gardenâ for all people to enjoy - which perhaps is the best phrase to describe what weâre creating here. This vision was replicated at places on Coney Island, like Luna Park, and George C. Tilyouâs Steeplechase Park, or Palisades Park. These were basically wonderlands, and I thought Francis Ford Coppola Winery could become such a park for the family to go and enjoy, where there are things for kids to do, so they can be close to their parents who are sampling wines and foods.Iâve often felt that modern life tends to separate all the ages too much. In the old days, the children lived with the parents and the grandparents, and the family unit each gave one another something very valuable. So when we began to develop the idea for this winery, we thought it should be like a resort, basically a wine wonderland, a park of pleasure where people of all ages can enjoy the best things in life - food, wine, music, dancing, games, swimming and performances of all types. A place to celebrate the love of life.â- Francis Ford CoppolaFor more than thirty years, we have been committed to environmentally responsible business practices. Itâs been our goal to minimize our impact on the environment by seeking out innovative ways to produce and package our goods.At Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all 24 planted acres are sustainably farmed and part of the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program. We try to purchase fruit from growers who farm sustainably, and some of the vineyards we source from are certified organic as well. Another benefit of participating in the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program is that we have subsequently become a learning-teaching vineyard. Every technique we implement is thoroughly documented so that we, and neighboring Sonoma winegrowers, can pinpoint the best ways to protect our land and craft the best wines from these vineyards.We are also actively involved in the Fish Friendly Farming certification program. While this may seem like a matter totally unrelated to wine, watershed quality management is intrinsically connected to farming our vineyard because our property includes two blue-line creeks. These creeks are a part of the Russian River watershed that supports steelhead trout and Coho salmon populations. In conjunction with our neighbors and local, state, and federal agencies, we work diligently to promote the overall health of the Russian River watershed so that the entire ecosystem remains in balance and is preserved for generations to come.Our winegrowing practices involve the Integrated Pest Management program, which discusses the best practices for maintaining soil and vine health and proactively farming to reduce and treat pest pressures. Field experts provide monthly lectures concerning pest problems and solutions which we implement in our vineyard. Through our integrated pest management program, we have complemented the biodiversity of our vineyard by promoting the presence of beneficial insects, soil fauna, and owls that combat pests of grapevines.Finally, we recycle our grape and water waste by fertilizing with composted grape pomace and irrigating only with reclaimed winery wastewater.  In effect, we have closed the loop on our waste system in an effort to reduce our carbon footprint on the land we so love.Outside of the vineyard, our Francis Coppola Diamond Collection wines are packaged in 100% recycled cardboard case boxes, and all of the corks we purchase come from sustainable cork forests. Additionally, we insist that the label and foil companies we do business with have environmentally friendly practices as well.During the reconstruction of Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all of the crews, vendors, and sub-contractors we hired were local residents, helping to cut down on transportation costs, as well as supporting the economy of our community.Rather than use new lumber for the construction, we reused the wood from the Redwood trees that were removed from the courtyard area. Some of this timber was used to build the main reception desk in the Guest Services building, while other portions has been used to build the outdoor dining tables. The pyramid skylights in our towers feature an environmentally friendly material called Kalwall to construct skylights. This material diffuses light in such a way that little artificial lighting is needed, which helps conserve energy.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Sutter Home  Pinot Grigio,United States,na,California,Pinot Gris,6.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the worldâs leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Marioâs son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his familyâs efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a âstuckâ fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Homeâs original philosophy to offer âa great product for a fair price,â even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Produttori del Barb Nebbiolo Langhe,Italy,Langhe,Piedmont,Nebbiolo,21.99,"Prior to 1894, Nebbiolo grapes were sold to make Barolo wine or simply labeled âNebbiolo di Barbarescoâ. But in 1894, Domizio Cavazza, headmaster of the Royal Enological School of Alba and a Barbaresco resident, created the first cooperative, the âCantine Socialiâ, by gathering together nine Barbaresco vineyard owners to make wine in the local castle that he owned. Cavazza understood that there were differences between Nebbiolo grapes grown in the Barolo district versus the same grapes grown in the Barbaresco district and, for the first time, recognized it on the wine label. The âCantine Socialiâ was forced to close in the 1920âS because of fascist economic rules. In 1958, the priest of the village of Barbaresco, recognizing that the only way the small properties could survive was by joining their efforts, gathered together nineteen small growers and founded the Produttori del Barbaresco. The first three vintages were made in the church basement, and then in the winery built across the square from where the Produttori is still located. United once again, the small growers continued the work started by Domizio Cavazza, producing only Barbaresco wine and enhancing both the reputation of the wine and the village. The proud past of Barbaresco and the dedication of its creators have made the Produttori one of the greatest producers in a great wine-producing area; it... âcontinues to set some of the highest standards of wine making for any cooperative in the worldâ. (Robert M. Parker, Jr.; The Wine Advocate, 2-28-90). The Produttori del Barbaresco, founded in 1958, now has 56 members and 100 hectares (250 acres) of Nebbiolo vineyards in the Barbaresco appellation, which amounts to almost 1/6 of the vineyards of the area.Each family is in full control of its land, growing Nebbiolo grapes with centuries old skill and dedication. The winery produces a Barbaresco D.O.C.G., a blend of Nebbiolo grapes harvested from different vineyards, and a simpler Nebbiolo Langhe suited for earlier consumption. In great vintages, nine single-vineyard Barbarescos are produced from nine classic premium sites within the Barbaresco village boundaries: Asili, Rabaja, Pora, Montestefano, Ovello, Paje, Montefico, Moccagatta and Rio Sordo. These are the geographical names of sites where Nebbiolo grapes have always been cultivated. The names of the single-vineyards, the total number of bottles produced, and the name of the owners of the vineyards are marked on the labels. The Produttori del Barbaresco, which vinifies only Nebbiolo grapes, produces around 420,000 bottles (35,000 cases) per year. In a good vintage they are divided among Barbaresco (40%), single vineyard Barbarescos (40%) and Nebbiolo Langhe (20%).

 Quady Elysium,United States,na,California,Black Muscat,24.99,"First there were two â Andrew and Laurel Quady left crowded southern California and their jobs in pyrotechnics and merchandising to pursue their dream: a non-urban way of life making wine. Returning to school, Andrew graduated with a Masters in Food Science-Enology from UC Davis and Laurel became a licensed CPA. In 1975, at the urging of friend Darrell Corti, they made their first port from Amador County Zinfandel in Lodi. In 1977, settled in Madera in Californiaâs San Joaquin Valley with Andrew working at a nearby winery, they built their own small winery behind their country home and made port on evenings and weekends. In 1980 they made a fortified dessert wine from the obscure Orange Muscat grape variety. The wine, Essensia, was unlike anything in the dessert wine field and became a major success. In 1983, opportunity knocked when they were offered a crop of Black Muscat grapes that became Elysium, the first dessert wine to smell of roses.Then there were four â By 1982 the expanding business needed space and Andrew and Laurel needed help. While still working on his winemaking degree at Fresno State, now winemaker Michael Blaylock moonlighted evenings during crush. Michael became Quadyâs full time winemaker in 1984 and never looked back. Quadyâs continued rise and recognition across the industry for extremely high quality is due to Michaelâs exacting standards from the vineyard to the bottle. Cheryl Russell, Quadyâs general manager also joined full time in 1984, and the dedicated team worked together to achieve consistent success. With their enthusiasm and integrity the winery continued to grow, developing more unique wines: Starboard (our euphemism for port), Electra (white and red) and Vya vermouth. For more about Quadyâs winemaker, Michael Blaylock, and general manager, Cheryl Russell, click here.Now there are more â Many of the Quady Winery staff have been with the winery for over twenty years. Production Manager Danny Mejia started in 1985 and Cellar Master Mauro Molina in 1988.

Our founder, Joe Martin, fell in love with Sonoma Valley and established St. Francis Vineyard in 1971, planting 22 acres of Chardonnay and the first 60 acres of Merlot in Sonoma Valley. After achieving great success as a grower, Joe opened his own winery in 1979 with his business partner Lloyd Canton.Our first winemaker, Tom Mackey, joined St. Francis in 1983 and was renowned for elevating both the quality and style of Sonoma Merlot as an ultra-premium, stand-alone varietal. He also cultivated an in-depth understanding of every Sonoma appellation, enabling us to acquire and develop new vineyards and expand our wine portfolio.In 1988 St. Francis partnered with the Kopf family, long admired for their historic family legacy in the wine and spirits industry and their commitment to quality. That legacy began in 1933 upon the repeal of prohibition when Rudy Kopf founded the wine and spirits department of Macyâs Department Store in New York, turning it into what was then one of the finest wine and spirits retailers in the country. He later established his own wine and spirits company, now owned by his three daughters.Today, a new generation of winemakers, Katie Madigan and Chris Louton, continues our long tradition of luscious, elegant, fruit-driven wines from Sonoma County grapes.  We farm more than 400 acres of Certified Sustainable estate vineyards in Sonoma Valley and Russian River Valley, each with varying compositions of loam, clay and volcanic soils.

In either system, fermentations are relatively short (two to three days) because Port is a fortified wine. Fortification, which involves the addition of natural grape spirit to the fermenting juice, intentionally interrupts the fermentation process at a point when approximately half of the grapesâ natural sugar has been converted into alcohol. This accounts for Portâs characteristic rich, luscious style and also contributes to the wineâs considerable ageing potential. Given the short fermentation cycle it is crucial to extract as much flavour, colour and tannins as possible from the grape skins.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Carmel Vineyard Emerald Riesling/ Chenin Blanc Kosher,Israel,Shomron,Galilee,Non-Varietal White Blend,9.99,"Carmel Winery is the historic winery of Israel. It was founded in 1882 by Baron Edmond de Rothschild, owner of Chateau Lafite in Bordeaux. Carmel owns the two largest wineries in Israel, at Rishon Le Zion, south of Tel Aviv and at Zichron Yaâacov, south of Haifa. Each has deep underground cellars built by Rothschild in the 19th century.The story of Carmel represents the story of Israel, and the recent developments of Carmelâs wine, symbolizes the revolution of Israeli wine in recent years.Carmel Winery has 3,472 acres of vineyards, which cover the land of Israel from the Upper Galilee in the north, to the Negev in the south. Carmelâs winemakers can therefore choose from vineyards with different terroirs from all the wine regions in Israel. Carmel has a particularly strong vineyard presence in the cooler climate of the Upper Galilee, from where many of the leading wines are sourced.Carmelâs Rishon Le Zion Wine Cellars, built in 1890, is the oldest winery in Israel still in use. Two future Israeli prime ministers worked there and the first ever use of electricity and telephone in Israel was at the winery. Rishon Le Zion is now the fourth biggest city in Israel and it has literally grown around the winery, which sits in the center of a residential area. Carmelâs main blending & bottling facility is at Rishon Le Zion, which is also where the companyâs head office is located.Carmelâs Zichron Yaâacov Wine Cellars, built in 1892, is the largest winery in Israel. On the premises is a modern, state-of-the-art facility making small quantities of quality wines from Carmelâs finest vineyards. The most advanced, modern winemaking technology blends in with the historic 120 year old cellars. The name of the winery is in memory of Edmond de Rothschildâs father, Baron James Jacob (Yaâacov) de Rothschild, who purchased the famous Bordeaux winery, Chateau Lafite, for the Rothschild family. Zichron Yaâacov is a charming town which still has an atmosphere of pre-state Israel. It is situated south of Haifa on the southern slopes of Mount Carmel, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.Lior Lacser is the Chief Winemaker of Carmel Winery. He is a graduate of CFPPA in Beaune in Burgundy. He has experience in both Burgundy and Bordeaux having worked at Domaine Comte Armand, Pommard and at Chateau le Bon Pasteur, Pomerol. He worked with Michel Rolland, one of the most influential winemakers in the world today. He followed this with work experience in Australia, working for Harmanâs Ridge Estate in the Margaret River region of West Australia. He joined Carmel in 2003 and was appointed the Chief Winemaker of Carmel Winery in 2005.Lacser heads a department of eight winemakers, and works closely with a team of expert viticulturists.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Coppola Diamond Pinot Noir Blue Label,United States,Monterey County,California,Pinot Noir,15.97,"âIâve always been influenced by the idea of Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, which was the inspiration for ultimately all modern amusements parks. I remember the beautiful theater pavilions with the curtains painted with peacock feathers that had little ballet performances. At Tivoli, there were rides, but more important than the rides were the cafes and the refreshments, and just the sense of being in a childrenâs garden, a âpleasure gardenâ for all people to enjoy - which perhaps is the best phrase to describe what weâre creating here. This vision was replicated at places on Coney Island, like Luna Park, and George C. Tilyouâs Steeplechase Park, or Palisades Park. These were basically wonderlands, and I thought Francis Ford Coppola Winery could become such a park for the family to go and enjoy, where there are things for kids to do, so they can be close to their parents who are sampling wines and foods.Iâve often felt that modern life tends to separate all the ages too much. In the old days, the children lived with the parents and the grandparents, and the family unit each gave one another something very valuable. So when we began to develop the idea for this winery, we thought it should be like a resort, basically a wine wonderland, a park of pleasure where people of all ages can enjoy the best things in life - food, wine, music, dancing, games, swimming and performances of all types. A place to celebrate the love of life.â- Francis Ford CoppolaFor more than thirty years, we have been committed to environmentally responsible business practices. Itâs been our goal to minimize our impact on the environment by seeking out innovative ways to produce and package our goods.At Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all 24 planted acres are sustainably farmed and part of the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program. We try to purchase fruit from growers who farm sustainably, and some of the vineyards we source from are certified organic as well. Another benefit of participating in the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program is that we have subsequently become a learning-teaching vineyard. Every technique we implement is thoroughly documented so that we, and neighboring Sonoma winegrowers, can pinpoint the best ways to protect our land and craft the best wines from these vineyards.We are also actively involved in the Fish Friendly Farming certification program. While this may seem like a matter totally unrelated to wine, watershed quality management is intrinsically connected to farming our vineyard because our property includes two blue-line creeks. These creeks are a part of the Russian River watershed that supports steelhead trout and Coho salmon populations. In conjunction with our neighbors and local, state, and federal agencies, we work diligently to promote the overall health of the Russian River watershed so that the entire ecosystem remains in balance and is preserved for generations to come.Our winegrowing practices involve the Integrated Pest Management program, which discusses the best practices for maintaining soil and vine health and proactively farming to reduce and treat pest pressures. Field experts provide monthly lectures concerning pest problems and solutions which we implement in our vineyard. Through our integrated pest management program, we have complemented the biodiversity of our vineyard by promoting the presence of beneficial insects, soil fauna, and owls that combat pests of grapevines.Finally, we recycle our grape and water waste by fertilizing with composted grape pomace and irrigating only with reclaimed winery wastewater.  In effect, we have closed the loop on our waste system in an effort to reduce our carbon footprint on the land we so love.Outside of the vineyard, our Francis Coppola Diamond Collection wines are packaged in 100% recycled cardboard case boxes, and all of the corks we purchase come from sustainable cork forests. Additionally, we insist that the label and foil companies we do business with have environmentally friendly practices as well.During the reconstruction of Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all of the crews, vendors, and sub-contractors we hired were local residents, helping to cut down on transportation costs, as well as supporting the economy of our community.Rather than use new lumber for the construction, we reused the wood from the Redwood trees that were removed from the courtyard area. Some of this timber was used to build the main reception desk in the Guest Services building, while other portions has been used to build the outdoor dining tables. The pyramid skylights in our towers feature an environmentally friendly material called Kalwall to construct skylights. This material diffuses light in such a way that little artificial lighting is needed, which helps conserve energy.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"
 Markham Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Napa County,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,33.99,"Bordeaux immigrant Jean Laurent came to California in 1852 to seek gold but instead founded one of the first wineries in Napa Valley. Laurent built his Napa winery in 1874, which started as a modest wooden structure. Business was good and in 1879 he built a stone cellar that is the heart of our present-day winery. Laurent was one of the largest producers of the California wine boom in the 1880s. In those days, wines were sold in bulk and shipped by train to the east coast. After Laurentâs death in 1890, the winery continued operating under a succession of owners.Bruce Markham arrived in the Napa Valley almost 100 years later, and like Laurent, he was looking to start a winery. He purchased vineyards in Yountville, Oak Knoll, and Calistoga and later the old Laurent winery, which was operating under the United Vintners (Heublein) at the time. In 1978, he founded Markham Vineyards and the old Laurent winery was reborn. In its early days Markham focused on Cabernet Sauvignon and introduced the first Markham Merlot with the 1980 vintage. From 1978 to 1988 the wineryâs production increased from 3,500 cases to 20,000 cases. The wine quality and praise from wine critics and consumers increased as well.In 1988, the old Laurent Winery once again opened a new chapter of its long distinguished life. The winery was sold to Mercian Corporation and began an ambitious renovation, expansion and vineyard-replanting program. These efforts would more than double the capacity and make Markham one of the most advanced, stunning winemaking facilities in the country. Even through the dust of the renovation, Markham was able to produce three of the number-one rated wines from California, as judged by Wine Spectator magazine.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Far Niente Chardonnay Estate,United States,Napa County,California,Chardonnay,59.99,"Far Niente Winery was established in 1885 by John Benson, a forty-niner of the California gold rush and uncle of the famous American impressionist painter, Winslow Homer. Benson hired architect Hamden McIntyre, creator of the former Christian Brothers winery-now the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone-to design the building. Constructed against a hillside in western Oakville, Far Niente functioned as a gravity flow winery, gently moving the grapes through each stage of production.Far Niente prospered until the onset of Prohibition in 1919, when it was abandoned and left to fall into disrepair. Sixty years later, in 1979, Gil Nickel purchased the winery and adjacent vineyard and began a three-year restoration of the property, which resulted in placement on the National Register of Historical Places. During restoration, the original name, Far Niente, from an Italian phrase that romantically translated means âwithout a care,â was found carved in stone on the front of the building where it remains to this day. We felt an obligation to preserve the name with the hope that we could recapture a bygone era when life was indeed without a care.Nineteen eighty-two marked the return of winemaking to Far Niente, with the harvest of the wineryâs first Cabernet Sauvignon. Chardonnay was also produced at the winery for the first time that year; the 1979, â80 and â81 vintage wines were made at an offsite location. Today, the winery continues to focus on producing only the two varietal wines.Californiaâs Oldest Bottle of WineFar Nienteâs past and present were reunited in 1998, when a bottle of Far Niente Sweet Muscat, vintage 1886, was discovered in a private cellar in Marin County, California. The bottle exhibits the original label, cork and capsule, and is believed to be the oldest intact bottle of California wine in existence today.The label, featuring a sepia-tone line drawing of a hammock laden with grape clusters, is believed to have been designed by Bensonâs nephew, artist Winslow Homer. Historians of the artist liken the style of the hammock on the label to the same technique employed in Homerâs other works. Eric Rudd, a historian and expert on Homer, has explained that while Homer created very little commercial art, he was known to have supplied his work to friends and relations for commercial use, including his cousin, Virginia Johnson. This was the same Virginia Johnson who inherited Far Niente in the early 1900s, from her uncle, John Benson.Today, Far Niente wines carry an intricate art nouveau-style parchment label, which was designed by artist Tom Rodrigues in 1979. Rodrigues also designed the labels for Far Nienteâs sister wineries Dolce, Nickel & Nickel and EnRoute, producer of Pinot Noir in the Russian River Valley.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

Lindeman, whose philosophy was to craft wines for everyday enjoyment.In 1843, Dr. Lindeman planted his first vineyard on his 330-acre property âCawarraâ in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. One hundred years later, the Lindemanâs Wine Company became a public listed company.By cellaring wines and not releasing them for sale until they had properly matured, Dr. Lindeman earned a reputation for producing wine of the highest quality. In 1973, the Lindemanâs Winery at Karadoc was built to cater for the increasing consumer demand for Lindemanâs wines around the world.Lindemanâs Bin 65 Chardonnay was first crafted for the Canadian market and launched in 1985 in response to the popularity of the Lindemanâs style of wines in the northern hemisphere.

 Baron Herzog Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,na,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,10.99,"The Jewish people have a special relationship to wine that predates even the Romans and Greeks. For the ancient Jews, whose temple in Jerusalem was renowned throughout the fledgling civilizations of the Middle East, wine played an important role in religious ritual. Today, thousands of years later, it continues to do so. Kiddush, the prayer over the wine, traditionally announces the beginning of the Sabbath on Friday night as well as other holidays.And so it should come as no surprise that the Herzog family has been making wine for a long time. They trace their winemaking origins back to Philip Herzog, who made wine in Slovakia for the Austro-Hungarian court more than a century ago. Philipâs wines were so appreciated by Emperor Franz-Josef, that the emperor made Philip a baron. The Baron Herzog wines-a line of premium yet moderately priced California varietals-are named to commemorate the honor.Baron Philip made both kosher and non-kosher wines. The kosher wines were made in a separate cellar and tasted remarkably like his non-kosher wines. Indeed, the wines were made in the same basic manner. However, the kosher wines required a Jewish, Sabbath-observant cellar crew.During World War II, Philipâs grandson Eugene hid his family from the Nazis by moving them around the Slovakian countryside. After the warâs end, he emerged from behind a false wall in a courageous Christian friendâs woodshed to reclaim his familyâs winery.But three years later, the new Czech communist regime drove the Herzogs away from their European home for good. Forced to leave with little more than the clothes on their backs, the family said goodbye to their former royal economic and social stature.Eugene brought the family to America in 1948 after the Holocaust.  He arrived in New York City with his wife, Sidonia, six of his own children and two additional war orphans. They moved to the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn with only enough money to rent a two-bedroom tenement flat. With his winemaking skills, Eugene found a job at a small kosher winery tucked away into a storefront on Manhattanâs Lower East Side. For a paltry salary, he made sweet, Concord-grape wines in the cellar. (European grape varieties for dry wines were not easy to obtain in post World War II New York.) He also drove the wine delivery truck. But because the company was so poor, he was paid for his driving acumen in company shares, not cash.For years the shares were worthless, but by 1958, all the other shareholders had given up their shares. They assumed the business was doomed to failure. Eugene and his sons, who all went to work at the winery, proved them wrong. They called their new venture Royal Wines, in deference to their grandfather, Philip.In 1985, the Herzog family decided to expand their winemaking operations to California, where they make wine under two separate labels: Baron Herzog and Herzog Wine Cellars. After twenty years of renting space in various wineries, the family was finally able to build its own state-of-the-art winery just south of Santa Barbara, in the town of Oxnard. Here, under the supervision of head winemaker Joe Hurliman, Herzog Wine Cellars has created a center for high-end contemporary winemaking in a tradition that dates back nearly six centuries.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

The grapes were 100% hand de-stemmed in our Clos Apalta Winery so we maintain complete control of the quality. We fill our French oak tanks by gravity. Then nature does its work, allowing native yeasts that slowly ferment the must into wine with temperature control less than 26Â° C. Macerations lasted for about 4-5 weeks and during all that period we did manual punch downs to extract enough compounds from skins and seeds to get the desired structure and concentration. We rack the young new wine straight into 100% new French oak barrels by gravity. Malolactic fermentation happens in barrels, where the wine stays for 22 months, ageing patiently.

 Joel Gott Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Napa County,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,14.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the worldâs leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Marioâs son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his familyâs efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a âstuckâ fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Homeâs original philosophy to offer âa great product for a fair price,â even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites.

 Carmel Sacramental Kosher,United States,na,New York,Non-Varietal Red Blend,15.99,"Carmel Winery is the historic winery of Israel. It was founded in 1882 by Baron Edmond de Rothschild, owner of Chateau Lafite in Bordeaux. Carmel owns the two largest wineries in Israel, at Rishon Le Zion, south of Tel Aviv and at Zichron Yaâacov, south of Haifa. Each has deep underground cellars built by Rothschild in the 19th century.The story of Carmel represents the story of Israel, and the recent developments of Carmelâs wine, symbolizes the revolution of Israeli wine in recent years.Carmel Winery has 3,472 acres of vineyards, which cover the land of Israel from the Upper Galilee in the north, to the Negev in the south. Carmelâs winemakers can therefore choose from vineyards with different terroirs from all the wine regions in Israel. Carmel has a particularly strong vineyard presence in the cooler climate of the Upper Galilee, from where many of the leading wines are sourced.Carmelâs Rishon Le Zion Wine Cellars, built in 1890, is the oldest winery in Israel still in use. Two future Israeli prime ministers worked there and the first ever use of electricity and telephone in Israel was at the winery. Rishon Le Zion is now the fourth biggest city in Israel and it has literally grown around the winery, which sits in the center of a residential area. Carmelâs main blending & bottling facility is at Rishon Le Zion, which is also where the companyâs head office is located.Carmelâs Zichron Yaâacov Wine Cellars, built in 1892, is the largest winery in Israel. On the premises is a modern, state-of-the-art facility making small quantities of quality wines from Carmelâs finest vineyards. The most advanced, modern winemaking technology blends in with the historic 120 year old cellars. The name of the winery is in memory of Edmond de Rothschildâs father, Baron James Jacob (Yaâacov) de Rothschild, who purchased the famous Bordeaux winery, Chateau Lafite, for the Rothschild family. Zichron Yaâacov is a charming town which still has an atmosphere of pre-state Israel. It is situated south of Haifa on the southern slopes of Mount Carmel, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.Lior Lacser is the Chief Winemaker of Carmel Winery. He is a graduate of CFPPA in Beaune in Burgundy. He has experience in both Burgundy and Bordeaux having worked at Domaine Comte Armand, Pommard and at Chateau le Bon Pasteur, Pomerol. He worked with Michel Rolland, one of the most influential winemakers in the world today. He followed this with work experience in Australia, working for Harmanâs Ridge Estate in the Margaret River region of West Australia. He joined Carmel in 2003 and was appointed the Chief Winemaker of Carmel Winery in 2005.Lacser heads a department of eight winemakers, and works closely with a team of expert viticulturists.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Dry Creek Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Sonoma County,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,20.99,"The history of Dry Creek Vineyard is a long and colorful one. Founded in 1972 by David S. Stare, Dry Creek Vineyard paved the way for a renaissance of winemaking and viticulture in the Dry Creek Valley. Before his arrival, the Dry Creek Valley was little more than a few family farms and prune orchards. It was Daveâs vision to start a Loire Valley inspired winery, which triggered a viticultural reawakening in northern Sonoma County.Without a doubt, David Stare is a pioneer. Heading west in the late 1960s, he personified the character and work ethic of early Gold Rush pioneers. Educated at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Dave worked for the B&O Railroad for several years but quickly realized that his true calling was in the wine industry. Inspired by his trips to the Loire Valley, he headed west to California to start his own family winery.Upon his arrival, Dave began taking winemaking classes at UC Davis as a graduate student. On the weekends, he spent time looking at vineyard land from Monterey to Mendocino. It was during one of those weekend trips that fate drew Dave to the Dry Creek Valley. When he saw an old prune orchard across the street from the Dry Creek General Store, Dave realized that he had found his dream location. He purchased the orchard and began planting vines. Captivated by his memories of Loire-style wines, Sauvignon Blanc seemed destined to figure prominently in the Dry Creek Vineyard portfolio. However, several famed vineyard specialists advised him against planting Sauvignon Blanc. Always looking to push the envelope, Dave planted the varietal anyway and the rest is history.Today, our second-generation family owned winery continues to evolve and grow to meet the demands of a global wine marketplace. The primary mission of our winery is to produce distinctive wines that overdeliver on quality. For more than 40 years, this pursuit of winemaking excellence has led to many international awards and accolades. With a loyal following of wine club members and customers, the future of Dry Creek Vineyard has never been brighter.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Frei Brothers Sauvignon Blanc,United States,Sonoma County,California,Sauvignon Blanc,15.99,"Frei Brothers Reserve is a winemaking story more than a century in the making. In 1890, Swiss immigrant Andrew Frei purchased the core of what is now Frei Ranch in Sonoma Countyâs Dry Creek Valley. The superb stretch of land was already a vineyard, but Frei brought it to prominence when he built a winery that produced 20,000 cases of wine annually by 1895. In 1903, Frei turned the winery over to his sons, Walter and Louis, who adopted the name Frei Brothers.After the repeal of Prohibition, the vineyards caught the eye of Julio Gallo, winemaker for the rapidly expanding E. & J. Gallo Winery. The Gallo family began buying grapes from Frei Ranch, eventually signing an agreement to purchase the estateâs annual wine grape crop.When Andrew Freiâs descendents retired in the late 1970s, the Gallo family purchased Frei Ranch, further developing the vineyard and the winery. Today, Frei Brothers Reserve carries on the rich legacy of both our home vineyard and Sonomaâs celebrated appellations.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Maculan Torcolato 375,Italy,Breganze,Veneto,Other White,39.99,"Torcolato is made entirely from handpicked Vespaiola grapes that have been slightly affected by botrytis, a noble rot that adds complexity to this luscious dessert wine. Before fermentation, the grapes are dried for four months in a traditional method that involves winding the bunches around twine and hanging them from the ceiling. These hanging clusters form a twisted rope; thus explaining the wine name âtorcolatoâ which, in local dialect, loosely translates as âtwisted.â",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

The juice is fermented on skins for up to 3 weeks allowing soft tannins to be formed into the rich and soft palate seen in many great Australian Shiraz`.The fermented wine is then drained and the skins pressed into a new vessel to allow a natural malolactic fermentation occur, giving a further softening and palate rounding to this rich variety.After settling, a portion of the volume is transferred to oak and allowed to mature for 6 months before blending back into the original wine, adding complexity and texture to the fruit driven palate.This wine is then chilled, clarified and bottled on the Estate to ensure maximum quality control in the final product.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Yellow Tail Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot,Australia,na,South Eastern Australia,"Cabernet Sauvignon,Merlot",12.99,"âPeople canât be bothered by all the hype and nonsense of wine. They just want to drink it.â ~John Casella.It all started in 1820, when the first Casellas planted some vines in the Italian countryside. Two things sprouted shortly thereafter: a cluster of grapes, and a family passion that would last 188 years and counting.Fast forward to 1957. Filippo and Maria Casella were keeping the business alive in Italy, when they decided to pack up and move to Australia. However far away, they couldnât escape their wine roots. Filippo began selling grapes to local wineries. Then in 1969, he decided it was time for a new generation of Casellas to put their winemaking skills to use.Following the blueprint of other Australian winemakers, Casella sourced his fruit from other growing areas throughout South Eastern Australia, creating wines with incredible freshness and character year after year. Still, almost a third of the grapes used for [yellow tail] are grown right in the Casella familyâs vineyards, nearly 540 acres in the Riverina region of Australia. In 1994, the Casellas built a new and improved winery, blending old world heritage with new world technology.From humble beginnings, this family has come a long way. Today the company is run by Filippoâs three sonsâJohn, Joe and Marcelloâwhile Filippoâs grandchildren have become the sixth generation to join the family business. In 2000, John Casella joined forces with another family-run company, W.J. Deutsch & Sons, to bring the goodness of [yellow tail] to the United States.Year after year, the Casella family continues to create quality wine thatâs fun, flavorful, and bursting with a personality all of its own.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Calera Pinot Noir,United States,Central Coast,California,Pinot Noir,28.99,"Calera was officially founded in 1975, when owner/winemaker Josh Jensen planted his first 24 acres of pinot noir in three separate parcels in Mt. Harlan. Having studied in Burgundy, Josh was determined to follow in his mentorsâ foot steps. He spent two years searching for limestone throughout California before finally purchasing a high-elevation parcel with a limestone subsoil in early 1974. (Limestone had even been commercially quarried here a 100 years earlier. To this day, there stands a magnificently well-preserved, 30-foot tall masonry limekiln, or âcaleraâ in Spanish. It thus serves as the wineryâs symbol and appears on every bottle of wine.)Located 90 miles south of San Francisco and about 25 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean, Calera is near Mt. Harlan in San Benito County. Its elevation is 2,200 feet above sea level, making it one of the highest and coolest vineyard properties in California. All the vineyards are based on selected cuttings from Burgundy (âCalera Selectionâ), with new vineyards started from massale selections taken from older plots.In the Burgundian tradition, Josh named each parcel individually to emphasize the fact that each would produce a distinct wine. The original plantings are the Selleck Vineyard (5 acres), Reed Vineyard (5 acres), and Jensen Vineyard (14 acres). These vineyards produced their initial tiny crop in 1978.Josh made Caleraâs first wine in 1975: 1000 cases of zinfandel produced from purchased grapes. During his first two years as a winemaker, he made the Calera wines in a rented space in a larger nearby winery. He gradually purchased more vineyard land, as well as property upon which he built his winery. Over the span of 25 years he transformed a multi-level rock crushing facility into a gravity-flow winery where the wines are moved by the mere force of gravity, rather than by the use of pumps. This multi-layered hillside construction has allowed for the gentlest possible handling of the Calera wines.In 1990 the U.S. government approved the Mt. Harlan AVA (American Viticultural Area), which is high in the Gavilan Mountains (the lowest point is at 1,800 feet above sea level). While it is a large AVA which comprises 7,400 acres, Caleraâs are the only vineyards in the Mt. Harlan Viticultural Area.Caleraâs winemaking is steeped in non-interventionist practices, such as the use of native yeasts, hand-harvesting, whole cluster fermentations, minimal racking, and fining and/or filtration only when necessary, insuring the bottled wines express all of the natural greatness of their vineyard origins.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the worldâs leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Marioâs son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his familyâs efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a âstuckâ fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Homeâs original philosophy to offer âa great product for a fair price,â even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites.

 Ghost Pines Zinfandel,United States,na,California,Zinfandel,14.99,"PHILOSOPHYAt the heart of every glass of Ghost Pines is the notion that world-class wines are made from quality grapes â grapes that span many appellations. An unconventional view against todayâs backdrop of single-appellation wines, the Ghost Pines philosophy is a modern take on visionary winemaker Louis M. Martiniâs approach to winemaking. In the 1930s, Martini didnât think about appellation boundaries. He simply sought the best grapes from the best vineyards to craft his unforgettable wines, long before American Viticulture Areas (AVAs) were established in California.Seventy-five years later, Napaâs historic Louis M. Martini Winery launched Ghost Pines to give Michael Eddy and a talented group of forward-thinking winemakers the freedom to blend the finest grapes across appellations. The result is a collection of sophisticated wines that illustrate the best characteristics of each varietal and region, balancing elegance with structure, intensity with nuance.Echoing the unharnessed, free-form character of its namesake tree, Ghost Pines embodies the progressive spirit of California winemaking: no boundaries, no limits. APPELLATIONSThe wines of Ghost Pines draw a veritable map of some of Californiaâs most renowned wine appellations. Vintner Michael Eddy and his team of progressive winemakers search for the best grapes in Napa, Sonoma, Monterey and San Joaquin counties to make a remarkable collection of multi-appellation blends. Each glass of Ghost Pines wine illustrates the diverse topography, soil and climate of Californiaâs most notable winegrowing regions.The art and science of winemaking at Ghost Pines begins in the vineyard. That vineyard spans counties and appellations, meandering across hills and valleys, blooming under sun-drenched skies and rolling fog. Our winemakers vary in climate, soil, elevation and proximity to the Pacific Ocean. Our wines bring to life the unique characteristics of each appellation.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Achaia Clauss Retsina,Greece,Achaia,Peloponnesos,"Roditis,Savatiano",8.99,"ACHAIA CLAUSS, located on the namesake hill, was founded in 1861 by the Bavarian Gustav Clauss who came to Patras in 1854 to work at a German raisin export company. On one of his trips, he got to know the region and was impressed by its stunning scenery. He initially bought a vineyard of just 15 acres and eventually built the Winecastle, still preserved until today.The sweet red wine that Gustav Clauss first produced in 1873 was given the name âMavrodaphneâ in honour of Daphne, his Greek beloved with the beautiful black eyes (Mavro means black in Greek), who died at a young age. Gustav Clauss is considered to be the inventor and establisher of the concept of Wine Tourism in Greece, following the visit of Austro-Hungarian Empress Sissi in 1885, in whose honour he even named a cellar (Imperial Cellar).",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

But the wines didnât change much during the secondary fermentations due to the lack of malic acidity. The lees were also very clean so Faure-Brac kept as much of them as possible, which he believes contributed to the ultimate freshness of the wines.

 Vampire Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,North Coast,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,9.99,"The year was 1985, and it was pitch dark on a rural highway somewhere in the Nevada desert.  The only visible lights were the stars up above, when Michael Machat first saw the vision  across the sky.  The image was red wine, and the name was Vampire. Some 3000 miles later Machat emerged in NY eager to share what, he thought, was a brilliant idea.  Unfortunately the reaction from the wine trade was  disbelief.  âA wine named Vampire?  What was this young New York lawyer thinking?â At that time the notion of calling a  wine VampireÂ®, let alone describing it as the Blood of the Vine!Â® was downright silly if not irreverent.  Wine was meant to be taken seriously; it wasnât meant for playing games.Not perturbed by the skeptics, the idea stayed with him.   Transylvania was the logical choice, but at the time it was ruled by the communist dictator Ceausescu, and marketing was illegal.   They too werenât interested in Machatâs ideas.  But the power of the vision stayed with him.Later that year music/trademark attorney, Michael Machat, visited  London for what was supposed to be a four week business trip.  It was here that he met the girl who would become the future Countess to Vampire wines, and his wife to this day - British beauty musician/writer Lisa Dominique.  Michaelâs one month stay in England lasted 7 years and in 1990, Michael married English rock star Lisa Dominique.While representing artists in England, Machat didnât give up on his vision.   Since Transylvania wasnât an option, he began elsewhere.  In 1988, while living in London, he released the first Vampire wine, a full bodied Algerian Syrah bottled in France.   Next was an Italian Sangiovese, which found its way back home to the Anne Rice Fan Club in New Orleans.It wasnât until 1990 when the Berlin Wall was torn down and the Romanian people executed their leader that Michael began his early trips to Transylvania seeking a winery for his concept. It wasnât easy. Marketing had been unlawful for 45 years and the Romanians had no appreciation for the western worldâs notion of a vampire. Many vintners were too proud to allow Machat to brand their wine as he envisioned. They had a different understanding of vampires, and convincing them that the idea would work was surprisingly not simple.In 1995, one decade after that road trip, Michael brought his  vision to life. He had at long last found a home for his idea in Transylvania.  From the soil and roots of the legendary Count Dracula, Vampire had arisen and the true blood of the vine was born.Over two decades have passed since that first production of Vampire wine in Transylvania, and we are proud to say it has been a wonderful journey of making our wines the best that they can be.  Along the way, both Michael and Lisaâs palates matured. They began demanding better and better wine for their Vampire Brand.So in 2007, the Machat family uprooted their connections in Transylvania and moved their wine production to California where they reside. The first California production was produced in Paso Robles. The following year the Machats began expanding the Vampire range, adding  Dracula and Trueblood to their upper range of wines.With an unyielding thirst for even more distinctive and sophisticated wines, the Machats established a winery up in Napa where they produce Cabernet Sauvignon,  Pinot Noir, and Chardonnay.

 Redstone Meadery Nectar Of Hops,United States,na,Colorado,na,17.99,"David Myers, known as âChairman of the Meadâ, founder of Redstone Meadery, is a romantic and wants to see mead once again enjoying the glory days of yesteryear. He started the Boulder, Colorado company with the ânatural philosophyâ that he produce the highest quality honey wine on the market.Because of this âphilosophy of meadâ, Redstone does not cork (to avoid oxidation) but instead uses swing top bottles. This ensures the mead will not breathe while cellaring plus offers a much longer shelf life once the bottle has been opened.In keeping with the ânaturalâ approach, Redstone does not add any sulfites, a known allergen, as honey is its own natural preservative. Redstone only pasteurizes the must (unfermented mead) and never boils. The company strives to feature the flavors of the fermentable as much as possible.In 2003 Redstone Meadery brought the International Mead Festival (www.meadfest.com) to Boulder, Colorado and with that helped to establish mead as its own beverage category. Also at this time Redstone spearheaded the creation of the International Mead Association (www.meadfest.org) to help promote and educate the masses about the worldâs first fermented beverage.Currently, Redstone products are distributed to 30 states across the U.S., making it the widest distributed wine from the state of Colorado and one of the most widely distributed meads in the country!

 Peter Mertes Riesling Platinum,Germany,na,Pfalz,Riesling,9.99,"In 1924 the winery owner and master winemaker Peter Mertes established his business in a small village called Minheim on the Mosel. His intention was to go beyond the simple wine-growing which can be documented for more than 600 years in the Mertes family. Peter Mertes had a clear goal: he wanted to supply his wine directly to his customers. The basis of this young venture were his extensive vineyards between the well-known wine towns of Bernkastel and Piesport on the Mosel.In the 1950s his son-in-law Dr. Gustav Willkomm began activities at the renowned wine sites on the Rhine (Nierstein, Oppenheim, Bingen, Mainz) and a little later in the Pfalz.In the 1960s the range was extended to include wines from the Rheingau and the Nahe. Through these offerings the customers and markets grew, today Peter Mertes wine is found in all parts of Germany and in many foreign markets. In addition to the Mosel vineyards which are constantly expanding, various wine cellars, bottling plants and modern, air-conditioned warehouses were established during the 1970s and 1980s. Today the company includes, for example, the biggest barrique cellar in Germany exclusively for German red wines, as well as prominent wine estates with prime vineyards.In the early days of industrialisation the pleasure of wine was a privilege of the upper classes. The vision of Peter Mertes was to appeal to a broad section of the population with select, sophisticated wines of the best quality. This still drives us today and is the basis of our company ethos. Recent years have seen a successful expansion in the Eastern European and Asian countries particularly with quality German wines. With several hundred employees in various locations, anologists, cellarmasters, viticulture specialists, sales and marketing professionals, Peter Mertes offers a wide range for wine lovers at home and abroad.

 Trentadue Old Patch Red,United States,na,California,Non-Varietal Red Blend,12.99,"The Trentadue family arrived in Sonoma County long before the region gained a reputation as the Wine Country. Life-long, hands-on agriculturists, Evelyn and Leo Trentadue contributed significantly to the advancement of their region over the years. In 1959, the Trentadues decided to flee the developers encroaching on their apricot and cherry orchards in Sunnyvale, the area known today around the world as Silicon Valley. To preserve their way of life, these hard-working Italian ranchers purchased 208 acres of land in Sonoma Countyâs then remote Alexander Valley.There was little market for the regionâs dry-farmed apples, prunes, pears, and grapes in the late 1950s, so land was cheap and plentiful. Scores of ranches were for sale but, because it was blessed with an excellent combination of climate, soil, and water, Leo settled on a special piece of property in the heart of the Alexander Valley. Little did he know what this ranch had once been, much less what it was to become.The piece of land, which is now home to Trentadue Winery, has a remarkable history. In 1868, a French botanist named Andrew Bouton established Heartâs Desire Nursery on this excellent site east of the railroad tracks. With a passion for breeding new and improved strains of fruit trees, Bouton devoted himself to plant propagation, becoming a major supplier of young tree stock to orchardists throughout the western United States. His reputation attracted the attention of a young man named Luther Burbank who visited Bouton frequently. Influenced by Bouton, Burbank conducted his own work in nearby Sebastopol and Santa Rosa.Shaping the Trentadue Estate Vineyards and WineryLeo Trentadue has a reputation for openness to new ideas. Over the years, this inveterate tinkerer has been among the first to experiment with what resulted in a number of viticultural/wine industry innovations. An overview of his unheralded achievements: From dry farming to irrigation. Horse drawn plows and dry farming were still practiced when the Trentadues arrived in the Alexander Valley. Leo introduced advanced irrigation practices common to his former home in Santa Clara County.The Trentadues were among the very first to plant new vines in Sonoma County since the days of Prohibition. Italians love their red wines, especially hearty reds like Carignane. In 1962, the Trentadue family began planting new Carignane vines in addition to the 68 acres of old vines already growing on their ranch. Now more than 115 years old, these vines are among the oldest producing Carignane vineyards in America. The family remains steadfastly devoted to this grape, and their wine ranks indisputably among just a handful of top ranked California Carignane. These vines continue to provide valuable character in many of our award winning wines.Understanding the importance of growing only those grape varieties, which excelled in his vineyards, in 1974 Leo installed half-acre blocks of eight different varietals. The quality of the Sangiovese was extraordinary, so all other vines were replanted to this famed variety from Tuscany. Because Evelyn and Leo share a Tuscan heritage, it is not surprising that in 1984 Trentadue was the first producer to release a 100% varietal wine named for this famed grape of Italy. The superior quality of this fruit has produced our most popular Tasting Room wine and has been the backbone for our La Storia Cuvee 32 blend, which is consistently one of the top wines produced from the Trentadue Estate.Leo had produced an incredible, award-winning 1973 Angelica and finally, in 1987, he encouraged his winemaker to experiment with fortified wines. An excellent Petite Sirah Port resulted, among the very first of its kind. The wine was well received, so a Merlot Port and eventually a Zinfandel Port were added to the line. Over the years, Trentadue has become the leading producer of dessert wines in the area, including the wildly popular Chocolate Amore.Connection to Ridge VineyardsThis wineryâs story cannot be told without mention of the Trentaduesâ remarkable long-term relationship with Paul Draper of Ridge Vineyards. Their personal history began in 1952 when the Trentadues became Paulâs neighbor in Santa Clara, after buying an old abandoned wine estate at the end of Montebello Road. Paul began buying fruit from their ancient vines, striking up a friendship which continues to this day.Both Draper and the Trentadues know a good thing when they see it. Draper was quick to benefit from the Trentaduesâ aptitude for viticulture. The Trentadues have similarly benefited from Draperâs wine business savvy. Indeed, it is Draper who encouraged the family to take advantage of their location and establish an estate winery.The list of mutual benefits derived from the Trentadue and Ridge association is extensive: Fruit from the Trentaduesâ Geyserville estate has been sold to Ridge Vineyards every vintage since 1967. In 1974, Ridge Vineyard acquired the Trentaduesâ mountaintop winery and vineyard today known as Montebello. Victor Trentadue manages not only 99 plus acres of his familyâs estate-owned fruit contracted to Ridge, but is also entrusted to manage 188 additional acres of Dry Creek Valley grapes under contract nearby to Draper.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Talbott Kali Hart Pinot Noir,United States,Monterey County,California,Pinot Noir,16.99,"In 1982, Robb Talbott began planting his original Diamond T Estate vineyard on a cold, windswept mountaintop in Carmel Valley. Conventional wisdom was against him, and many said the steep, exposed site with its massive shale boulders was âtoo cold,â âtoo difficult to plantâ and âtoo challenging to grow on.â But Robb had a vision-a vision he held on to as he prepared the cliff-side vineyard by hand, breaking apart its massive boulders with a 12-pound sledgehammer. âIt all began with my first taste of a great Burgundy,â says Robb.Diamond T Vineyard Map âThat experience profoundly shaped my palate, and as I grew older I knew that I wanted to create unique and exceptional Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs. Wines that took their inspiration from the traditions of Burgundy, but had their roots in Californiaâs soils.âTo achieve this goal, Robb Talbott established one of the Central Coastâs most esteemed estate programs, featuring two of Monterey Countyâs grand cru sites: Diamond T Estate and the legendary Sleepy Hollow Vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands. Though located a mere 18 miles apart, these two vineyards offer remarkably different growing conditions, yielding rich and distinctive Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs that embody their unique terroirs.At its heart, the history of Talbott Vineyards is the story of one familyâs determined focus and commitment to excellence. In 1950, Robert Talbott, Sr., his wife Audrey, and their son, Robb, moved to Carmel, California, where they started a luxury tie company. Audrey sewed the ties by hand and Robert, Sr. sold them up and down the California coast. During silk buying trips to Europe for their business, the Talbotts visited French and Italian vineyards and soon became interested in fine wine. As their interest grew, they aspired to produce their own California wines, using the Burgundian techniques that they had become passionate about.Diamond T ShaleIn 1982, Robb planted Diamond T, and the Talbotts built their original winery in idyllic Carmel Valley. For his first plantings, Robb selected the storied Corton-Charlemagne Chardonnay clone, planting it in Diamond Tâs almost soil-free chalky shale. Robb knew that the vines would have to struggle to survive at Diamond T, producing miniscule yields and wines of great intensity.After years of working with fruit from Sleepy Hollow Vineyard, in 1994 the Talbotts achieved another important milestone when they were able to acquire the property-making Talbott an all-estate winery. Featuring blocks of old Wente clone vines planted in 1972, Sleepy Hollow has earned a reputation for producing wines of great depth and voluptuousness. Today, Sleepy Hollowâs River Road block is home to the wineryâs state-of-the-art winemaking facility, where Robb Talbott and renowned winemaker Dan Karlsen guide Talbottâs storied Chardonnay and Pinot Noir programs. These estate wines have gained a reputation for their lushness, grace and great aging potential, and have become benchmarks of quality on the Central Coast..",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

The chateau was plundered and burned down during the Fronde insurrection, then rebuilt in the 17th century. It was re-named Cru du Roy in the late 18th century on being taken over by a nephew of the Suduiraut family, Jean Joseph Duroy, Baron of Noaillan. The family home then acquired a cartouche featuring the Suduiraut and Duroy coats of arms, which was to give rise to the escutcheon used by Chateau Suduiraut today. The property was planted with magnificent formal gardens, designed by Le Notre, King Louis XIVâs renowned gardener. On 18 April 1855 the estate was classed as a Premier Cru during the official wine classification programme in the Gironde winegrowing area. AXA Millesimes acquired Suduiraut in 1992 with the aim of preserving and perpetuating the estateâs remarkable tradition of vineyard management and winemaking.

 Chateau Tanunda Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,Barossa,South Australia,Cabernet Sauvignon,49.99,"Iconic historic wineryChateau Tanunda is the Barossa.This majestic bluestone winery and vineyard property is a living testament to the colorful history and pioneering spirit attached to Australiaâs pre-eminent wine region. Now, thanks to the passion and dedication of its new owners, the Geber family, this icon Barossa estate is celebrating a new lease on life.Built in the late 1880s, Chateau Tanunda is:Home to some of the earliest plantings of vines in the Barossa Valley, dating back to the 1840sAustraliaâs largest (37,674 square feet) and oldest wine ChateauA designated monument in Australiaâs Register of State Heritage PlacesChateau Tanundaâs origins go back to the 1860s and the decimation of Europeâs vineyards by the phylloxera plague. Sensing opportunity in Europeâs pain, the three founders of Chateau Tanunda built a Bavarian-style Chateau dedicated to the production of fine quality wines.This grand vision would become for a while the largest winemaking facility in the Southern Hemisphere.European immigrants had been planting vines in the Barossa since the 1840s, so the region was a natural choice. The resulting wines, made from grapes produced by 560 local growers (paid a pound per gallon â a substantial sum at the time), were transported on company-owned ships to a wine-starved Europe.Chateau Tanundaâs success was the Barossaâs success. For years it was the heart of Barossa winemaking. A veritable âIvy Leagueâ of Australian winemakers worked or studied at the facility, including Max Schubert, the creator of Grange Hermitage; Prof. Soebels, Australiaâs first qualified enologist; Bill Seppelt; Grant Burge; Geoff Merrill and others. In 1994, in recognition of its rich history, Chateau Tanunda was placed on the Register of State Heritage Places â but by then its glory days were a memory.Abandoned by its then owner, Australian wine giant Southcorp, the property was a shell of its former grandeur. When John Geber chanced upon it in 1998, and bought it a day later, he embraced the challenge of restoring this magnificent property to its iconic status.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Silver Oak Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley,United States,Napa County,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,119.99,"It All Began With a HandshakeSilver Oak began over a handshake between two friends with a bold vision: focus on one varietal, Cabernet Sauvignon, aged exclusively in American oak and worthy of cellaring for decades to come.Our FoundersRaymond Twomey Duncan, a Colorado entrepreneur who began investing in California vineyards in the late 1960s, and Justin Meyer, a winemaker and former Christian Brother, began in a Napa Valley dairy barn in 1972, producing only 1,100 cases of their inaugural vintage.Over the next two decades, Silver Oak grew in popularity. Our Napa Valley and Alexander Valley Cabernets sold quickly upon their release from the winery and became a sought-after staple on restaurant wine lists around the country. After selecting Daniel Baron to succeed him as winemaker in 1994, Justin retired, selling his share of Silver Oak to the Duncan family in 2001.With David R. Duncan serving as President and CEO and Tim Duncan as Executive Vice President, the Duncan family continues to operate the winery to this day.âWe RebuildâIn 2006, a fire destroyed our historic Oakville winery. It was a difficult and emotional event; but in hindsight, a blessing in disguise. When we regrouped on the morning of the fire, we knew we had to rebuild, and it wasnât long before the excitement of a new, state-of-the-art winery overcame our sense of loss.Today, we are applying this experience from our LEED Platinum Oakville winery toward a new winery in the Alexander Valley. Set amidst 70 acres of estate vineyards along the rolling foothills of the Mayacamas mountains, our new Alexander Valley winery - set to open for harvest 2017 - will push industry design and innovation standards through alternative energy sources, innovative water reuse systems and reclaimed building materials.Continuous ImprovementâWe have yet to make our best bottle of wine,â or the idea that our best wines are still ahead of us, is a philosophy that guides everything we do. In 2015, we became the first North American winery to own and operate an American oak cooperage, giving us full control over the quality of our barrelmaking needs.Today, we farm more than 400 acres of vines in Napa Valley and Alexander Valley with a leading-edge approach toward precision viticulture, allowing us to give our vines exactly what they need, when they need it. All of our estate vineyards are certified under Californiaâs Sustainable Winegrowing program.In 2014, Nate Weis joined us as only the third winemaker in our 45-year history. Nate worked side-by-side with Daniel Baron, just as Daniel worked with Justin Meyer before his retirement.

 Pascual Toso Estate Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza,Cuyo,Malbec,9.99,"When in the mid 1880s Pascual Toso set out towards Argentina from its home town, Canale DâAlba, in Piamonte, Italy, he could not have imagined that he would become the founder of a winery, which is today one of the oldest and most prestigious wineries in Argentina. When he arrived in Argentina, he settled in Mendoza. As he had been closely involved in the development of his family wine business in Piedmont, he promptly saw the promising future for winemaking in the region and decided to use his expertise. Thus, in 1890, Pascual Toso established his first winery in San Jose, Guaymallen. At the beginning of the 20th century, he decided to expand his business and acquired vineyards in Maipu. At his estate âLas Barrancasâ, he built another winery, âLas Barrancasâ (small Canyon) which is dedicated to producing and growing the finest grapes. In 2001, the Bodega hired as winemaker consultant to Mr. Paul Hobbs for a new high quality wine project. He has been working head to head with our chief winemaker, Rolando Luppino, on the development of premium and super-premium wines. Today, Pascual Toso still makes wines of high quality under the most exigent procedures and rules. The Trophy for Best Argentine Producer awarded by the IWSC (London) in 2007 reflects this commitment to quality. Today, the brand benefits of a real success in the national market but also worldwide. The Bodega has gained 12 years of experience in exporting to international markets and the wines are available in more than 30 markets such as United Kingdom, USA, Japan, Europe, Russia, Korea, Canada and Latin America. The most important is our passion for the wines and the quality we try to achieve. Since 1890, Bodegas y Vinedos Pascual Toso has become one of the most exciting and promising Argentine wineries and remains faithful to its principles: Tradition, Authenticity, Innovation.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 14 Hands Merlot,United States,Columbia Valley,Washington,Merlot,10.99,"The inspiration for 14 Hands wines recalls a time when wild mustangs once freely roamed the hills of eastern Washington State. These small horses, measuring a scant 14 hands high - a âhandâ being equivalent to a manâs palm width and how horses were measured then - would travel down from the hills every day to drink from the mighty Columbia River and graze upon the luscious waist high grasses along the riverbank, and then retreat back up into the hills to cool off at night. Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir. With the fruit from these tenacious vines, 14 Hands wines are handcrafted into big, bold, juicy fruit forward reds and crisp, fruit forward white wines that are laced with the unbridled spirit and legend of the region.14 Hands celebrates the spirit of these wild horses, and the rich and unique history of Washington wines not only in our wines, but also in the vibrant colors and images on our popular varietal labels and our new Hot to Trot red and white blend wines. Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience â fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price.

 Talbott Kali Hart Chardonnay,United States,Monterey County,California,Chardonnay,15.99,"In 1982, Robb Talbott began planting his original Diamond T Estate vineyard on a cold, windswept mountaintop in Carmel Valley. Conventional wisdom was against him, and many said the steep, exposed site with its massive shale boulders was âtoo cold,â âtoo difficult to plantâ and âtoo challenging to grow on.â But Robb had a vision-a vision he held on to as he prepared the cliff-side vineyard by hand, breaking apart its massive boulders with a 12-pound sledgehammer. âIt all began with my first taste of a great Burgundy,â says Robb.Diamond T Vineyard Map âThat experience profoundly shaped my palate, and as I grew older I knew that I wanted to create unique and exceptional Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs. Wines that took their inspiration from the traditions of Burgundy, but had their roots in Californiaâs soils.âTo achieve this goal, Robb Talbott established one of the Central Coastâs most esteemed estate programs, featuring two of Monterey Countyâs grand cru sites: Diamond T Estate and the legendary Sleepy Hollow Vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands. Though located a mere 18 miles apart, these two vineyards offer remarkably different growing conditions, yielding rich and distinctive Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs that embody their unique terroirs.At its heart, the history of Talbott Vineyards is the story of one familyâs determined focus and commitment to excellence. In 1950, Robert Talbott, Sr., his wife Audrey, and their son, Robb, moved to Carmel, California, where they started a luxury tie company. Audrey sewed the ties by hand and Robert, Sr. sold them up and down the California coast. During silk buying trips to Europe for their business, the Talbotts visited French and Italian vineyards and soon became interested in fine wine. As their interest grew, they aspired to produce their own California wines, using the Burgundian techniques that they had become passionate about.Diamond T ShaleIn 1982, Robb planted Diamond T, and the Talbotts built their original winery in idyllic Carmel Valley. For his first plantings, Robb selected the storied Corton-Charlemagne Chardonnay clone, planting it in Diamond Tâs almost soil-free chalky shale. Robb knew that the vines would have to struggle to survive at Diamond T, producing miniscule yields and wines of great intensity.After years of working with fruit from Sleepy Hollow Vineyard, in 1994 the Talbotts achieved another important milestone when they were able to acquire the property-making Talbott an all-estate winery. Featuring blocks of old Wente clone vines planted in 1972, Sleepy Hollow has earned a reputation for producing wines of great depth and voluptuousness. Today, Sleepy Hollowâs River Road block is home to the wineryâs state-of-the-art winemaking facility, where Robb Talbott and renowned winemaker Dan Karlsen guide Talbottâs storied Chardonnay and Pinot Noir programs. These estate wines have gained a reputation for their lushness, grace and great aging potential, and have become benchmarks of quality on the Central Coast..",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Alba Riesling,United States,na,New Jersey,Riesling,12.99,"Wine growing is all about site selection. Quality wine comes from prime vineyard sites.  Elevation, soil/air drainage, soil composition, and climate are all very important factors into cultivar selection.  Albaâs 93-acre estate is nestled in the rolling hills of Warren County, specifically on the north side of the Musconetcong river valley, a tributary of the Delaware river.  We are a part of the Warren Hills AVA where our vineyard rests between the elevations of 250â and 650â above sea level providing the farm with ample drainage of cold air; which helps to mitigate spring frosts and prolong our growing season. All of our vineyards blocks are on sloped terrain, varying from 5% to 30% grade, coupled with the southern exposure this provides our vines with all the sunlight exposure they could ever need.  This farm dates back to the late 1700âs, originally a dairy farm, our vineyards are the first cultivation of the land. This means the soils are as healthy as they can possible be and were never subject to years of other farming and depletion of nutrients.We believe in the value of vineyard ownership as a means of producing wines of exceptional quality, distinctive character, and consistency year after year.

 Baron Herzog Pinot Grigio,United States,na,California,Pinot Gris,10.99,"The Jewish people have a special relationship to wine that predates even the Romans and Greeks. For the ancient Jews, whose temple in Jerusalem was renowned throughout the fledgling civilizations of the Middle East, wine played an important role in religious ritual. Today, thousands of years later, it continues to do so. Kiddush, the prayer over the wine, traditionally announces the beginning of the Sabbath on Friday night as well as other holidays.And so it should come as no surprise that the Herzog family has been making wine for a long time. They trace their winemaking origins back to Philip Herzog, who made wine in Slovakia for the Austro-Hungarian court more than a century ago. Philipâs wines were so appreciated by Emperor Franz-Josef, that the emperor made Philip a baron. The Baron Herzog wines-a line of premium yet moderately priced California varietals-are named to commemorate the honor.Baron Philip made both kosher and non-kosher wines. The kosher wines were made in a separate cellar and tasted remarkably like his non-kosher wines. Indeed, the wines were made in the same basic manner. However, the kosher wines required a Jewish, Sabbath-observant cellar crew.During World War II, Philipâs grandson Eugene hid his family from the Nazis by moving them around the Slovakian countryside. After the warâs end, he emerged from behind a false wall in a courageous Christian friendâs woodshed to reclaim his familyâs winery.But three years later, the new Czech communist regime drove the Herzogs away from their European home for good. Forced to leave with little more than the clothes on their backs, the family said goodbye to their former royal economic and social stature.Eugene brought the family to America in 1948 after the Holocaust.  He arrived in New York City with his wife, Sidonia, six of his own children and two additional war orphans. They moved to the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn with only enough money to rent a two-bedroom tenement flat. With his winemaking skills, Eugene found a job at a small kosher winery tucked away into a storefront on Manhattanâs Lower East Side. For a paltry salary, he made sweet, Concord-grape wines in the cellar. (European grape varieties for dry wines were not easy to obtain in post World War II New York.) He also drove the wine delivery truck. But because the company was so poor, he was paid for his driving acumen in company shares, not cash.For years the shares were worthless, but by 1958, all the other shareholders had given up their shares. They assumed the business was doomed to failure. Eugene and his sons, who all went to work at the winery, proved them wrong. They called their new venture Royal Wines, in deference to their grandfather, Philip.In 1985, the Herzog family decided to expand their winemaking operations to California, where they make wine under two separate labels: Baron Herzog and Herzog Wine Cellars. After twenty years of renting space in various wineries, the family was finally able to build its own state-of-the-art winery just south of Santa Barbara, in the town of Oxnard. Here, under the supervision of head winemaker Joe Hurliman, Herzog Wine Cellars has created a center for high-end contemporary winemaking in a tradition that dates back nearly six centuries.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Castello di Bossi Chianti Classico,Italy,Chianti,Tuscany,Sangiovese,17.99,"The winemaking revolution which in the last few years has taken place in Chianti Classico and in Tuscan winemaking in general could hardly have left untouched as well a historic winery estate such as Castello di Bossi.Develop to the fullest extent possible the potential represented by this estate and embrace modern technology, while respecting at the same time the character of the Chianti heartland: these were the tasks we set ourselves to bring our wine house into the highest ranks of international wine.The programme took decades to come to full fruition, with the Bacci family carefully selecting the most talented staff for that purpose and setting uncompromising quality as its single most important goal.Today the Castello di Bossi covers 650 hectares , on which 124 are under vine. By utilising only the most enlightened viticultural practices, we harvest, vintage after vintage, prize fruit that represents to the fullest extent the qualities of terroir and of their individual grape varieties.Those 124 hectares planted to Sangiovese, the main variety of Chianti Classico and of Tuscany in general; and to Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, which were planted at Bossi some forty years ago, probably among the first in Chianti Classico.Their roots go deep into soils that are predominantly tuffs, yellow clays, silt-sand, and crushed rock, at an altitude of about 350 meters . These conditions, plus a unique microclimate and optimal exposition to the sun, yield grapes that are perfectly ripe, healthy, and of great character.The grapes ferment in temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks fitted with the most advanced processing systems. The wine then matures and rests in the barrel cellar, with over 1,000 light-toast French oak barrels. The state-of-the-art bottling line is temperature-controlled as well, and feeds directly into the bottle-storage facility. It, too, is fully insulated and fully cold- and heat-regulatable.Absolutely fundamental for keeping our standards of quality high is our ambitious programme of replanting, carried out on a cyclic basis and due for completion in 3-4 years.Castello di Bossi wines are distributed through a network of business partners.

 Cabreo Al Borgo,Italy,na,Tuscany,"Cabernet Sauvignon,Sangiovese",49.99,"The grapes achieve optimum ripeness and are picked at different times: the Sangiovese first, in the first half of October and the Cabernet Sauvignon in the second half. Focus is on the most gentle treatment possible of the grapes during production. The destemming process uses two conduits rather than a screw augur, which leads into a perforated cylinder in which the skins are separated from the stems without shredding. Fermentation takes place over a period of seven to eight days in stainless steel tanks at a controlled temperature of 28Âº to 32ÂºC (79Âº to 89ÂºF). The Sangiovese is in contact with the skins for a total of seven to ten days, and the Cabernet for a period of roughly fifteen days or slightly longer. Three maceration methods are used: manual punch-down; mechanized submersion of the cap with pistons; and juice pump-over. The skins are drained and gently balloon-pressed at 1.2 atmospheres pressure. Malolactic fermentation is then carried out in stainless steel tanks at a controlled temperature of 22Âº to 23Â°C (73Âº to 74ÂºF). The two varieties are then bended and matured in French oak ""carati,"" or barriques, with racking every three months over a total period of 15 to 18 months in oak. After bottling, the wine rests a minimum of six months before release. Production averages 7,500 cases annually.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

Strong and tenacious, these little horses became known for their endurance and were revered around the world.This unique and beautiful landscape that gave these unbridled horses their spirit and tenacity now feeds our vines. With loamy-sand and gravel soils, these hills require a strong and determined grapevine, and our 14 Hands vines revel in this unique and world class terroir.

Whether you enjoy 14 Hands by the glass in your favorite restaurant, or share a bottle with family or friends, our wines are the quintessential Washington wine experience â fruit-forward, easily enjoyable with any meal or on any occasion, and delivering a superb value for the price.

 Sassicaia,Italy,Bolgheri,Tuscany,Bordeaux Blend,299.0,"The legacy of Sassicaia begins in 1944, when Mario Incisa acquired a number of Cabernet Sauvignon and Franc vine cuttings and planted them on a sloping hillside of the San Guido estate, called Castiglioncello after the 11th-century castle at the vineyard's upper edge.  This tiny, 3.75-acre vineyard stood alone until 1965, when a second Cabernet vineyard was planted with cuttings from the Castiglioncello parcel; the gravelly, 30-acre plot would give the wine its name: Sassicaia, ""the place of many stones"".  This and a slightly more elevated microclimate of 20 acres, called Aianova, were planted in phases between 1965 and 1985, bringing plantings to the present extent of 90 acres in vines averaging 20 to 25 years of age. Since the late 1960s, Sassicaia has represented a standard of production that is without compromise.  The grapes are hand picked, destemmed, crushed and fermentation is set off by natural yeasts in stainless steel tanks.  For the first week, pumping over of the must takes place three times daily; during the second week, this is reduced to once daily until the end of the 14-day fermentation period.  The wine is pressed from the skins and undergoes full malolactic fermentation.  Aging takes place in 225-litre Allier and TronÃ§ais oak barriques, approximately 30 percent of which are new, for 18 to 22 months depending on vintage.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 La Scolca Gavi White Label,Italy,Gavi,Piedmont,Cortese,15.99,"Founded in 1919, La Scolca is the first producer of quality Gavi and ranks among the most historic white wine producers in Italy. Although Cortese had been planted in the region since the late 19th Century, the grape produced low-alcohol, thin and sour wines that quickly oxidized. Consequently, the production was mostly purchased by Cinzano and Martini & Rossi as a base for their sparkling wines. It was the Soldati family, who after the Second World War saved the fate of Cortese from oblivion by focusing entirely on the production of quality Cortese, in a region traditionally known for its reds. They pioneered modern, controlled vinification in stainless steel to preserve the subtle fruit of the Cortese grape, allowing for the creation of wines that retained crisp acidity and aromas and gained structure. Today, the Estate is run by Giorgio Soldati, the founderâs great-grandson, and his daughter, Chiara, representing the fifth generation. The Estateâs 50 hectares of vineyards are planted on the hills surrounding the family villa, in the Rovereto Superiore region of the commune of Gavi, the âGrand Cruâ terroir for Cortese. Located 30-miles from the Mediterranean, marine air tempers the cool mountain air and all-day sunlight is ideal for ripening. Vineyards are planted on steep slopes at a density of 50 quintals/ha, half that allowed by the DOCG. Soils are composed of calcareous-clay and volcanic soils with iron, shot with veins of chalky limestone similar to that found in Champagne and Chablis, giving that characteristic flinty character. All of La Scolcaâs white wines follow the same vinification process: hand-harvested fruit is brought to the winery after 5-10 minutes, where it is sprayed with dry ice. Cryo-maceration, cold fermentation (13-14ÂºC) and the use of natural yeasts preserves the Corteseâs subtle fruit, flinty acidity and structure. With Piedmontâs oldest Cortese vines (60+ years) and decades of pioneering, family winemaking tradition, La Scolca produces spectacular, complex and concentrated age-worthy wines now found on the worldâs finest wine lists. The 2014 vintage will mark La Scolcaâs 95th harvest. La Scolca adheres to European Union Regulation 2078/92, which encourages conversion to organic farming practices to reduce carbon footprint and other negative impact on the environment from both farming and vinification. Some practices include: no use of pesticides and minimal use of chemicals in the cellar; water used in the winery is filtered three times and recycled.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

The barrels range in age from one to two years old, and the majority of the wine is aged in the older barrels. The barrel-fermented component is periodically stirred, a process called ""bÃ¢tonnage,"" to redistribute the lees, which enriches the wine's texture and helps integrate the fruit flavors with the oak nuances.

The Pinot Noir benefits directly from the influence of the nearby Pacific Ocean which provides cool daytime breezes during bright sunny days to ensure proper ripening and chilly evening fogs to guarantee lively acidity for freshness in the finished wines.HARVESTAll of our fruit is hand-harvested into small bins in the early morning to protect the fruit and preserve freshness.  At the winery, hand sorting begins on our custom-built shaker table.  Pinot Noir clusters are dispersed and gently conveyed to the next sorting table where six sorters assess the clusters that will be allowed to pass to the fermenters.FERMENTATION AND CELLARINGAt Flowers, Pinot-Noir is partially de-stemmed  to provide a 75% whole-berry environment in our small open-top fermenters.  Pinot Noir is cold-soaked for five to seven days at a temperature of 45Â° F and the hand-punching-down begins.  After the cold-soak period, the fermenter is warmed to 68 Â°F to 85 Â°F and wild yeast carries the fermentation to showcase the terroir and complexity.  Once fermentation is complete the wines are left in contact with the skins for 10-15 days to further enhance flavor and color development.Free-run wines are drained using natural gravity flow to French oak barrels and the remaining skins are gently pressed in a small traditional basket press.  All wines are aged between 14-16 months in small French oak barrels from Burgundian Coopers.   Our philosophy is to retain all of the natural vineyard elements while hand-crafting our Pinot Noir.

Carmel owns the two largest wineries in Israel, at Rishon Le Zion, south of Tel Aviv and at Zichron Yaâacov, south of Haifa. Each has deep underground cellars built by Rothschild in the 19th century.The story of Carmel represents the story of Israel, and the recent developments of Carmelâs wine, symbolizes the revolution of Israeli wine in recent years.Carmel Winery has 3,472 acres of vineyards, which cover the land of Israel from the Upper Galilee in the north, to the Negev in the south. Carmelâs winemakers can therefore choose from vineyards with different terroirs from all the wine regions in Israel. Carmel has a particularly strong vineyard presence in the cooler climate of the Upper Galilee, from where many of the leading wines are sourced.Carmelâs Rishon Le Zion Wine Cellars, built in 1890, is the oldest winery in Israel still in use. Two future Israeli prime ministers worked there and the first ever use of electricity and telephone in Israel was at the winery. Rishon Le Zion is now the fourth biggest city in Israel and it has literally grown around the winery, which sits in the center of a residential area. Carmelâs main blending & bottling facility is at Rishon Le Zion, which is also where the companyâs head office is located.Carmelâs Zichron Yaâacov Wine Cellars, built in 1892, is the largest winery in Israel. On the premises is a modern, state-of-the-art facility making small quantities of quality wines from Carmelâs finest vineyards. The most advanced, modern winemaking technology blends in with the historic 120 year old cellars. The name of the winery is in memory of Edmond de Rothschildâs father, Baron James Jacob (Yaâacov) de Rothschild, who purchased the famous Bordeaux winery, Chateau Lafite, for the Rothschild family. Zichron Yaâacov is a charming town which still has an atmosphere of pre-state Israel.

While still maintaining grape sales to top wineries around the world, they brought award-winning winemaker Steve Millier aboard to launch Kautz wines, which would evolve into Ironstone Vineyards, a wine brand dedicated to the production of exceptional wines of unparalleled quality, outstanding value and everyday approachability. The next big step for Ironstone was the creation of a âhomesite,â a winery and visitors center that would exemplify the Kautz family commitment to excellence, and provide an environment that would reach beyond the world of winemaking to include the support all of the cultural arts.In 1989, using dynamite, pick axes and shovels, a crew of miners carved through limestone and Calaveras Schist Rock on Gailâs family ranch in Murphys, California and fashioned the site of Ironstoneâs wine aging caverns, which in the beginning, also served as the facilityâs first tasting room.

Always a pioneer, Sandeman was the first company to brand its name on a cask with a hot iron. In 1805, the GSC (George Sandeman Co.) signature was a guarantee of quality for the wine it sold. It was also one of the first companies to label and advertise its wines, which in the early nineteenth century were already being exported to several countries in Europe, North and South America, Africa and Asia. The âSandeman Donâ is one of the worldâs first ever brand images and the first major icon in the wine world. It was painted in 1928 by George Massiot Brown and, with its Coimbra (Portuguese) studentâs black cape and the typical Jerez (Spanish) âsombreroâ, it still retains all its mystique and attractiveness, to represent the seduction and mystery of the Sandeman brand. Sandemanâs international success was underlined in 1990 with the launch of a more modern portfolio and a new advertising campaign that emphasised a less traditional, younger and more innovative âDonâ. In 2002, Sogrape Vinhos incorporated Sandeman into its business, reinforcing its status as a major international operator in the wine sector with one more truly global brand in its portfolio. For over two centuries, Sandeman has based its success on a rare capacity for innovation and expertise handed down from generation to generation. Currently, Sandeman clearly stands out as âtheâ worldwide Port Wine and Sherry brand and proudly signs: âSandeman, Famous for Pleasure.â",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

Vineyards were a secondary concern.Nicky immediately saw that the land heâd purchased was destined for greater things than grazing stock. He wasted no time. In 1980, the Hahns released their first wine from SLH. A mere eight years later, Nicky led the charge to establish SLH as an American Viticultural Area, a dream he saw realized in 1991.Today, Hahn Family Wines, now run by Nicky and Gabyâs son Philip, owns and sustainably farms 650 acres of estate vineyards in the Santa Lucia Highlands.

 Sutter Home 4-Pack Moscato,United States,na,California,Muscat Blanc A Petits Grains,6.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the worldâs leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Marioâs son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his familyâs efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a âstuckâ fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Homeâs original philosophy to offer âa great product for a fair price,â even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites.

 Ghost Pines Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,na,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,16.99,"PHILOSOPHYAt the heart of every glass of Ghost Pines is the notion that world-class wines are made from quality grapes â grapes that span many appellations. An unconventional view against todayâs backdrop of single-appellation wines, the Ghost Pines philosophy is a modern take on visionary winemaker Louis M. Martiniâs approach to winemaking. In the 1930s, Martini didnât think about appellation boundaries. He simply sought the best grapes from the best vineyards to craft his unforgettable wines, long before American Viticulture Areas (AVAs) were established in California.Seventy-five years later, Napaâs historic Louis M. Martini Winery launched Ghost Pines to give Michael Eddy and a talented group of forward-thinking winemakers the freedom to blend the finest grapes across appellations. The result is a collection of sophisticated wines that illustrate the best characteristics of each varietal and region, balancing elegance with structure, intensity with nuance.Echoing the unharnessed, free-form character of its namesake tree, Ghost Pines embodies the progressive spirit of California winemaking: no boundaries, no limits. APPELLATIONSThe wines of Ghost Pines draw a veritable map of some of Californiaâs most renowned wine appellations. Vintner Michael Eddy and his team of progressive winemakers search for the best grapes in Napa, Sonoma, Monterey and San Joaquin counties to make a remarkable collection of multi-appellation blends. Each glass of Ghost Pines wine illustrates the diverse topography, soil and climate of Californiaâs most notable winegrowing regions.The art and science of winemaking at Ghost Pines begins in the vineyard. That vineyard spans counties and appellations, meandering across hills and valleys, blooming under sun-drenched skies and rolling fog.

The recipe comprised of water, honey, hops and brewers yeast, and concludes that âon the eight day - or earlier in emergencies - the mead may be drunk, but the longer it is left, the purer, better and healthier it will be.âOur products are brewed based on a recipe from about year 1700, and the ingredients are pure and 100% natural - guaranteed free from additives of any kind. Honey is the major and most important item in the recipe. Dansk Mjod A/S is Scandinaviaâs largest meadery; products include many varieties of mead, grappa, spirits, sparkling wine, mustard, jam, chocolate, and sweets.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Annabella Merlot,United States,Napa County,California,Merlot,13.99,"Michaelâs wine roots trace back to the late 1800âs in Piedmont, Italy where his great grandfather first planted vines.  After traveling to America in the early-mid 1900âs, Michaelâs grandfather moved to Sonoma where he planted 35 acres of Zinfandel in 1948. Some of these original vines still exist today and can be seen at the end of Pozzan Road in Healdsburg, Sonoma County.  Michael grew up spending his summers at his grandparentâs vineyard and it is the foundation from which his passions spawned.As a young adult, Michael became involved in the California wine industry working for several companies focused on imports and distribution.  It wasnât until 1990 that Michael, with the loving support of his wife Mary Ann, left his sales position to follow his dream of producing his own wine.  Displaying a keen pallet and a knack for blending, Michael Pozzan released his first vintage in 1991, consisting of 200 cases.  Over the years his success grew as he formed stronger relationships with winemaking peers and growers, giving him the edge in producing fine wines from the most competitive region in the country. Now celebrating over 25 years of production, Michael is joined by his two sons, Dante and Matthew Pozzan, as the family winery looks to continue their passion of producing fine wines with balance and personality.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Sandeman Rich Madeira,Portugal,Madeira - Madeirense,Terras Madeirenses,Madeira Blend,21.99,"The House of Sandeman was founded in London in 1790 by George Sandeman, a young Scot from Perth who decided to invest Â£300 borrowed from his father in creating a business marketing wines from Porto (Portugal) and Jerez (Spain ). The innovation revealed from the outset, would eventually carry Sandeman to a notable position in the wine and spirit sector, and the company is today undoubtedly one of the most recognized brands in the world. Always a pioneer, Sandeman was the first company to brand its name on a cask with a hot iron. In 1805, the GSC (George Sandeman Co.) signature was a guarantee of quality for the wine it sold. It was also one of the first companies to label and advertise its wines, which in the early nineteenth century were already being exported to several countries in Europe, North and South America, Africa and Asia. The âSandeman Donâ is one of the worldâs first ever brand images and the first major icon in the wine world. It was painted in 1928 by George Massiot Brown and, with its Coimbra (Portuguese) studentâs black cape and the typical Jerez (Spanish) âsombreroâ, it still retains all its mystique and attractiveness, to represent the seduction and mystery of the Sandeman brand. Sandemanâs international success was underlined in 1990 with the launch of a more modern portfolio and a new advertising campaign that emphasised a less traditional, younger and more innovative âDonâ. In 2002, Sogrape Vinhos incorporated Sandeman into its business, reinforcing its status as a major international operator in the wine sector with one more truly global brand in its portfolio. For over two centuries, Sandeman has based its success on a rare capacity for innovation and expertise handed down from generation to generation. Currently, Sandeman clearly stands out as âtheâ worldwide Port Wine and Sherry brand and proudly signs: âSandeman, Famous for Pleasure.â",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Sutter Home  Pink Moscato,United States,na,California,Muscat Rose A Petits Grains,6.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the worldâs leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Marioâs son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his familyâs efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a âstuckâ fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Homeâs original philosophy to offer âa great product for a fair price,â even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites.

 Coppola Diamond Malbec,United States,na,California,Malbec,14.99,"âIâve always been influenced by the idea of Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, which was the inspiration for ultimately all modern amusements parks. I remember the beautiful theater pavilions with the curtains painted with peacock feathers that had little ballet performances. At Tivoli, there were rides, but more important than the rides were the cafes and the refreshments, and just the sense of being in a childrenâs garden, a âpleasure gardenâ for all people to enjoy - which perhaps is the best phrase to describe what weâre creating here. This vision was replicated at places on Coney Island, like Luna Park, and George C. Tilyouâs Steeplechase Park, or Palisades Park. These were basically wonderlands, and I thought Francis Ford Coppola Winery could become such a park for the family to go and enjoy, where there are things for kids to do, so they can be close to their parents who are sampling wines and foods.Iâve often felt that modern life tends to separate all the ages too much. In the old days, the children lived with the parents and the grandparents, and the family unit each gave one another something very valuable. So when we began to develop the idea for this winery, we thought it should be like a resort, basically a wine wonderland, a park of pleasure where people of all ages can enjoy the best things in life - food, wine, music, dancing, games, swimming and performances of all types. A place to celebrate the love of life.â- Francis Ford CoppolaFor more than thirty years, we have been committed to environmentally responsible business practices. Itâs been our goal to minimize our impact on the environment by seeking out innovative ways to produce and package our goods.At Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all 24 planted acres are sustainably farmed and part of the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program. We try to purchase fruit from growers who farm sustainably, and some of the vineyards we source from are certified organic as well. Another benefit of participating in the California Sustainable Winegrowing Program is that we have subsequently become a learning-teaching vineyard. Every technique we implement is thoroughly documented so that we, and neighboring Sonoma winegrowers, can pinpoint the best ways to protect our land and craft the best wines from these vineyards.We are also actively involved in the Fish Friendly Farming certification program. While this may seem like a matter totally unrelated to wine, watershed quality management is intrinsically connected to farming our vineyard because our property includes two blue-line creeks. These creeks are a part of the Russian River watershed that supports steelhead trout and Coho salmon populations. In conjunction with our neighbors and local, state, and federal agencies, we work diligently to promote the overall health of the Russian River watershed so that the entire ecosystem remains in balance and is preserved for generations to come.Our winegrowing practices involve the Integrated Pest Management program, which discusses the best practices for maintaining soil and vine health and proactively farming to reduce and treat pest pressures. Field experts provide monthly lectures concerning pest problems and solutions which we implement in our vineyard. Through our integrated pest management program, we have complemented the biodiversity of our vineyard by promoting the presence of beneficial insects, soil fauna, and owls that combat pests of grapevines.Finally, we recycle our grape and water waste by fertilizing with composted grape pomace and irrigating only with reclaimed winery wastewater.  In effect, we have closed the loop on our waste system in an effort to reduce our carbon footprint on the land we so love.Outside of the vineyard, our Francis Coppola Diamond Collection wines are packaged in 100% recycled cardboard case boxes, and all of the corks we purchase come from sustainable cork forests. Additionally, we insist that the label and foil companies we do business with have environmentally friendly practices as well.During the reconstruction of Francis Ford Coppola Winery, all of the crews, vendors, and sub-contractors we hired were local residents, helping to cut down on transportation costs, as well as supporting the economy of our community.Rather than use new lumber for the construction, we reused the wood from the Redwood trees that were removed from the courtyard area. Some of this timber was used to build the main reception desk in the Guest Services building, while other portions has been used to build the outdoor dining tables.

Some of these original vines still exist today and can be seen at the end of Pozzan Road in Healdsburg, Sonoma County.  Michael grew up spending his summers at his grandparentâs vineyard and it is the foundation from which his passions spawned.As a young adult, Michael became involved in the California wine industry working for several companies focused on imports and distribution.  It wasnât until 1990 that Michael, with the loving support of his wife Mary Ann, left his sales position to follow his dream of producing his own wine.  Displaying a keen pallet and a knack for blending, Michael Pozzan released his first vintage in 1991, consisting of 200 cases.  Over the years his success grew as he formed stronger relationships with winemaking peers and growers, giving him the edge in producing fine wines from the most competitive region in the country.

 Coppola Directors Cut Cabernet Sauvignon Alex Vly,United States,Sonoma County,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,21.99,"âIâve always been influenced by the idea of Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, which was the inspiration for ultimately all modern amusements parks. I remember the beautiful theater pavilions with the curtains painted with peacock feathers that had little ballet performances.

This vision was replicated at places on Coney Island, like Luna Park, and George C. Tilyouâs Steeplechase Park, or Palisades Park. These were basically wonderlands, and I thought Francis Ford Coppola Winery could become such a park for the family to go and enjoy, where there are things for kids to do, so they can be close to their parents who are sampling wines and foods.Iâve often felt that modern life tends to separate all the ages too much. In the old days, the children lived with the parents and the grandparents, and the family unit each gave one another something very valuable. So when we began to develop the idea for this winery, we thought it should be like a resort, basically a wine wonderland, a park of pleasure where people of all ages can enjoy the best things in life - food, wine, music, dancing, games, swimming and performances of all types.

This soil composition is quite extreme already, but the terroir is also transformed by temperature variations spanning 50 degrees over the course of a day in the height of summer. The grapes that are harvested in January (the southern hemisphereâs equivalent of July) which is relatively early compared to other producers in the region.

The original winery, outside of Naoussa, has a 124-acre vineyard. There are also five other wineries located throughout Greece in Goumenissa, Attica, Mantinia, Santorini, and Crete. Resurrecting the unique qualities of the indigenous grape varieties of classical Greece, sometimes combining them with more well-known French varietals such as Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, Boutari has elevated the quality of wines from this most ancient of wine-growing countries. It is sometimes hard to believe that the history of winemaking owes so much to Greece, given that the wines of this country are rarely the focus of the wine writing of this era. Greek winemaking has gone through some very difficult times, both economic and stylistic. However, Boutari has seized the moment, and is making wines of real style and substance. They clearly have improved vineyard practices, making wines of more concentration and balance. More importantly, they have improved winemaking practices, integrating such techniques as stainless steel, cold-temperature fermentation and French oak barrel aging. Today, Boutari is the worldâs number-one selling Greek wine, and has earned its place on any fine table.Over 125 Years of Wine ArtThe Boutari family embarked on their journey as vintners in 1879, in Naoussa, when Yianni Boutari founded his familyâs winery, giving body and soul to his vision of a winemaking enterprise with a progressive philosophy. The first step was the creation of his signature red wine, Naoussa, followed in 1906 by the establishment of the familyâs first winery facility.Generation succeeded generation, each bringing new vigor to the company while remaining steadfastly committed to the principle of quality in all areas. The primary emphasis was on Greek grape varieties for the domestic and international market. Boutari wines have become ambassadors of the Greek wine landscape, winning countless international awards. Foreign varieties are cultivated on an experimental basis in many parts of Greece, yielding marvelously unique wines. With an eye to the future, the company continues to invest in equipment and in the purchase of vine-growing land in selected areas.Today there are Boutari Estate wineries in select appellations in Greece, each one superbly situated to yield top quality wines.With respect for tradition and dedication to quality, Boutari continues to explore new horizons.

Bob focused on growing his familyâs efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a âstuckâ fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Homeâs original philosophy to offer âa great product for a fair price,â even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

Susana was the first Argentine winemaker to be hired as a consultant to make wine outside of Argentina. She has made wine in Australia, California, Chile, France, Italy, South Africa, and Spain, and she spends a month each year in a different wine region of the world studying with local winemakers and growers. After twenty years of producing wines for others, Susana decided it was time to apply her education and experience to her own wines and put her name right on the bottle. Susana strives for balance in her wines, with layers of complexity coming from the individually fermented varietals.

Davis Bynum was tinkering with wine. He created Barefoot Bynum Burgundy in that tiny room. But our spirited ways really began with our founders, Michael Houlihan and Bonnie Harvey. In 1986, they took a sleepy label and gave it Sole. Both agreed it was time for a wine that didnât take itself too seriously. So, Barefoot Cellars was created (Bonnie liked the name because it was easy to pronounce) and initially run out of their home. Some say the office was so small you had to go outside to change your mind. Our founders began with two big varietals that were all about bringing the fun back. California Cabernet Sauvignon and California Sauvignon Blanc. Michael and Bonnie searched for the perfect image to represent their new wine. Finally, Bonnie just rolled out some paper, stepped on the biggest inkpad she could find and left her mark. Itâs been on our label ever since.Through the years, people have gone head over heels for our wine. Weve received some amazing recognition and professional awards. More importantly, weve made some amazing friends. We have a growing circle of Foot Fans who love to enjoy our wine and join us in giving back. Thats something worth toasting to.

From these Pritchard Hill vineyards, the Chappellets have been crafting extraordinary, age-worthy wines since 1967.Pritchard Hillâs rugged terroir has become legendary for producing wines with great intensity and depthâqualities that define the worldâs finest Cabernet Sauvignons.

The goal of the project is to produce wines that drink like $30-$40 bottles, but sell for under $20.For most vintages, this Bordeaux blend contains all five of the main varietals, including Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec, and Petit Verdot. The wine is sourced from several top sites in Washington including the Sheridan Vineyard (made famous by Andrew Willâs single vineyard bottling), Champoux, Goose Ridge and Coyote. The wine is aged for 22 months in predominantly French oak, with about 15% new. Stylistically, Ex-Libris Cabernet Sauvignon leads with its beautiful, plummy/cassis fruit, but there is also a bit more restraint and structure (and Bordeaux spirit) than your typical domestic Cab.

Albaâs 93-acre estate is nestled in the rolling hills of Warren County, specifically on the north side of the Musconetcong river valley, a tributary of the Delaware river.  We are a part of the Warren Hills AVA where our vineyard rests between the elevations of 250â and 650â above sea level providing the farm with ample drainage of cold air; which helps to mitigate spring frosts and prolong our growing season. All of our vineyards blocks are on sloped terrain, varying from 5% to 30% grade, coupled with the southern exposure this provides our vines with all the sunlight exposure they could ever need.  This farm dates back to the late 1700âs, originally a dairy farm, our vineyards are the first cultivation of the land. This means the soils are as healthy as they can possible be and were never subject to years of other farming and depletion of nutrients.We believe in the value of vineyard ownership as a means of producing wines of exceptional quality, distinctive character, and consistency year after year.

 Vinferno Bonny Doon Vineyard,United States,Monterey County,California,Grenache Blanc,19.99,Randall Grahm and his iconic winery need no introduction to California wine lovers and itâs not a stretch to call Bonny Doon the Rhone variety pioneer for the state and in fact the United States.

To say that his is a restless mind would be a severe understatement. In recent vintages Grahmâs wines have been presenting a refreshingly low-octane low-impact character with plenty of aromatic complexity and the distinctly Old World slant that has always been a signature of the Bonny Doon wines.

Our Napa Valley and Alexander Valley Cabernets sold quickly upon their release from the winery and became a sought-after staple on restaurant wine lists around the country.

 Joel Gott Chardonnay Unoaked,United States,na,California,Chardonnay,14.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the worldâs leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Marioâs son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his familyâs efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a âstuckâ fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Homeâs original philosophy to offer âa great product for a fair price,â even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites.

An unconventional view against todayâs backdrop of single-appellation wines, the Ghost Pines philosophy is a modern take on visionary winemaker Louis M. Martiniâs approach to winemaking. In the 1930s, Martini didnât think about appellation boundaries. He simply sought the best grapes from the best vineyards to craft his unforgettable wines, long before American Viticulture Areas (AVAs) were established in California.Seventy-five years later, Napaâs historic Louis M. Martini Winery launched Ghost Pines to give Michael Eddy and a talented group of forward-thinking winemakers the freedom to blend the finest grapes across appellations. The result is a collection of sophisticated wines that illustrate the best characteristics of each varietal and region, balancing elegance with structure, intensity with nuance.Echoing the unharnessed, free-form character of its namesake tree, Ghost Pines embodies the progressive spirit of California winemaking: no boundaries, no limits. APPELLATIONSThe wines of Ghost Pines draw a veritable map of some of Californiaâs most renowned wine appellations. Vintner Michael Eddy and his team of progressive winemakers search for the best grapes in Napa, Sonoma, Monterey and San Joaquin counties to make a remarkable collection of multi-appellation blends. Each glass of Ghost Pines wine illustrates the diverse topography, soil and climate of Californiaâs most notable winegrowing regions.The art and science of winemaking at Ghost Pines begins in the vineyard. That vineyard spans counties and appellations, meandering across hills and valleys, blooming under sun-drenched skies and rolling fog. Our winemakers vary in climate, soil, elevation and proximity to the Pacific Ocean.

 Sutter Home  Riesling,United States,na,California,Riesling,6.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the worldâs leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Marioâs son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his familyâs efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a âstuckâ fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Homeâs original philosophy to offer âa great product for a fair price,â even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

The factory does not process only the grapes grown at the 5 Santeroâs wine farms, but also the grapes bought from over three hundred local winegrowers.The production capacity of the winery is in excess of 18 million bottles per annum which is above all due to the strong presence of the main export markets.Santero has changed the packaging to modernity. In a static and traditional anchored segment, fixed on consolidated forms and images, it is necessary to begin with an innovative identity able to get itself noticed and be impressed without deceiving both accessibility codes and segment daily life in order to give style, elegance and the own brand contemporaneity to all the products. Great attention has been given to the bottle study giving distinctiveness and authority to the product; finally the use of Santero logo in relief increases value and quality to the whole product. Labels by particular shape and shading colours with attention both to every detail and to all particulars, both to the shadings and to the reflexions, give a touch of elegance to the whole bottle.Large areas grown with mono grape wine and a rich endowment of historical wine cellars dug into the tufa, of ancient farmhouse by elegant architectures, of medieval villages enhanced by churches and castles of a secular culture based on the wine production. Santero carries out its activity in a corner of Piemonte between Langhe and Monferrato: a wavy territory, lively and charming by the colour games gifts both by spontaneous plants and cultivations. Quality is not a myth of communication, but a concrete fact. In Santo Stefano Belbo Santero lives in strong contact with agriculture world that characterizes its tradition of historic wine company.

 Ramsay Cabernet,United States,North Coast,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,15.99,"After twenty-eight years of making wine, Kent Rasmussen Winery is as busy as ever, with a few changes.Kent Rasmussen and wife, Celia Ramsay, ran the family winery they started in 1986 at their beautiful facility in St. Helena. Unlike most wineries in the Napa Valley, they never wanted to have a public presence in the form of a tasting room, but sell their wines in Bay Area & California restaurants & stores, and in 28 other states. Famous for the Kent Rasmussen and Ramsay brand wines, and best known for making âpurely poetic Pinot Noirâ, the couple raised their family of four on the Silverado Trail property.The kids grew up and fledged the nest, and Kent and Celia realized they longed for a more urban life. They moved their winemaking operations to share another family-run facility owned by their long-time friend, Stefano Migotto in Napa. Then they bought a home in Berkeley. With a very reasonable reverse-commute to Napa, Kent is happy to be back in the southern end of the Napa Valley, especially since his original winemaking start was in the Napa-Carneros. Kentâs passion for winemaking is as strong as ever. He has often stated that the unfortunate truth about wine is that you only get one chance a year to make it; he jokes, âI think Iâm finally figuring out how it all works!â New projects for Kent include a wine brand that is sold in foreign markets only, under the label Six Eight Nine. His second passion is the Berkeley house-a Maybeck-designed home that was once owned by the Alfred Kroeber family. (Alfred Kroeber was the anthropologist famous for his work with Ishi, the last of the Yahi people of the Lassen area of California.) For those of you who are fantasy/sci-fi fiction fans, it is the house that Ursula K. LeGuin grew up in, and she claims the house made her into a writer.And even though Celia still handles the winery compliance, she has picked up an old thread in her life-music. Sheâs becoming well known in the Bay Area music scene as a vocalist, studio artist and songwriter, with performances at the Freight and Salvage, and many house concerts, singing both traditional folk music and 1940s style Jazz. She has two bands that she works with: Luxury Edition for Jazz, and Glamourie for Celtic-flavored folk. Celia continues to work as a professional dance teacher from Ukiah to Monterey âcallingâ the New England style form called Contra Dance.Since its modest beginnings in a garage in 1986, the Kent Rasmussen Winery has evolved as its ownerâs lives have changed. It continues to be one of the most important Pinot Noir producers in California.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

The plan was three-fold: to restore the Sullenger farmstead, construct new buildings that are architecturally compatible to the historic structures, and house an ultra-modern winery uniquely suited to producing single-vineyard wines.âOur goal was to develop a modern winery, specially outfitted to meet the needs of single-vineyard winemaking, while respecting the history of the location,â says Nickel & Nickel director of winemaking and chairman, Dirk Hampson. He adds, âAnyone driving past on Highway 29 will see a restored farmstead that appears to have been there for generations, without realizing the classic barns house an extremely sophisticated winery.âThe Sullenger farmstead is arranged around three sides of a barnyard and surrounded by 80-year-old olive trees and a white, three-rail fence.

 Martini & Rossi Bianco,Italy,na,na,Non-Varietal White Blend,11.99,"MARTINIÂ® captures the spark that set two men on a lifelong quest to make their stamp on Italian culture. Alessandro Martini - a spirited entrepreneur with a global vision - and Luigi Rossi - a creative muse whose botanical fragrances would lure noses along Turinâs via Dora Grossa... The year was 1863 when their newfound partnership was manifested in their first vermouth: The MARTINIÂ® Rosso. This original blend remains the same to this day.These are the words immortalised on the gates of Casa Martini. âWhere thereâs a will, thereâs a wayâ, echoes the shared vision of Alessandro Martini and Luigi Rossi to represent the greatest in Italian quality and style.Since 1864, the fields of Pessione in northern Italy are where our heart calls home. The Turin-Genoa railway line passes right beside us, which was key to our ambition of expansion. Generations of families have built Martini to what it is today. Local faces are rich with pride and the air is sickly sweet with the aroma of our vermouth.Our artisans of today are 8th generation MARTINIÂ® masters. Each following in the footsteps of their predecessors. All dedicated craftsmen and custodians of MARTINIÂ®âs quality and integrity. The only three people worldwide to know Mr. Rossiâs original recipe.Originally from a village just outside our home of Pessione, and a student of the world-renowned Scuola Enologica di Alba, where many MARTINIÂ® experts have honed their craft. After 18 years of training, Musso succeeds the 30-year tenure of former master blender, Luciano Boero.MARTINIÂ®âs original recipe remains guarded under lock and key.

Before this epic event, wine in Eastern Europe was mainly a bulk product from frightfully high yields resulting in quality on par with the Yugo or Trabant.Founded in 1885, Tikve Winery has witnessed the independence of the Balkans, two world wars and one cold one, yet through it all they have continued to make wines from grapes native to the region: RKaticeli, Kratosija, Vranec and Plavec. With the fall of communism and independence of Macedonia this historic estate was privatized and new investments were made to update the practices in the vineyard and cellar. Sustainable farming has replaced industrial farming, yields have been lowered and indigenous varieties have been preserved.

 Echeverria Unwooded Chardonnay,Chile,Curico Valley,Valle Central,Chardonnay,9.99,"The Echeverria family came to Chile in the 1750s, from a little town called Amezqueta in the Basque region of Spain. They established agricultural properties in the north of Santiago, where they planted vineyards, among other crops. Some 200 years later in 1930, Roger Piffre de Vauban, a French Engineer from Montpellier, and Roberto EcheverriaÂ´s maternal grandfather, travelled to Chile and hence to Chileâs Curico Valley, some 200km south of the capital Santiago. Here he planted ungrafted vines from pre-phylloxera French origin on an expanse of land called La Estancia, in a little town called Molina. He established there what, at that time, was a frontier technology winery with French equipment and machinery brought directly from France. Itâs aim was to supply high quality wines for the domestic market. Soon after, Adriana Piffre de Vauban, RogerÂ´s daughter, married Roberto Echeverria Rubio, and they had one child, Roberto Echeverria. In the early 1950s, after developing diverse industries, Roberto Echeverria Rubio, established a vineyard and winery also in Molina, encouraged by the family relationship with the ongoing winery at the La Estancia estate.He grew strongly influenced by these two family winemaking activities, and developed an intense love and passion for winemaking, that would lead him to pursue university studies to obtain a degree in Agronomy and Winemaking, which he complemented soon after with Economics, obtaining a PhD at Cornell University in the US. After graduating from Cornell, Roberto worked for eight years as an economist in the World Bank. He lived in Washington D.C., together with his wife Gloria and his children, and travelled intensively worldwide. In his frequent travels, he became aware of the tremendous potential that the production of fine wines had to satisfy the growing demands of more quality-oriented consumers.In 1979 Roberto decided to return to Chile to continue his family tradition in winemaking, and to focus on emerging new market trends and opportunities. He thought he was coming back to join an ongoing winery operation, but he arrived in a country in which the wine industry was in the midst of a great depression. Many wineries had gone bankrupt, and very little wine was being exported. The family business was in jeopardy and the old winery in which he spent his summers was on the brink of disappearing.Passionate about wine, and determined to preserve his ancestorsâ winemaking tradition, he embarked on the greatest challenge of his life: projecting his winery into the future, transforming it into a modern, export-oriented, and family-owned and managed operation. It would take Roberto nearly 15 years of intense conviction and sacrifice to develop these radical changes, which included replanting the entire estate and building a new winery from the ground up, and to finally bring his first wine to the international market in 1993. During the 20 years that followed he and Gloria travelled to every continent in the world, showing their wines and winning over many of the customers that are still working with them today. It was their extraordinary vision, determination and commitment to excellence, that was to make Vina Echeverria what it is today.Today Vina Echeverria is still a family-owned and managed estate winery, and its vineyards and house occupy the same location as they did nearly 100 years ago. The 65 hectares of sustainably farmed vineyards in Chileâs Central Valley are planted, tended and harvested by the Echeverria family. Roberto Echeverria is still very active in the family business and continues to inspire the whole family to develop new projects and delight new customers. Together with his four children, Paulina, Viviana, Roberto and Diego they hand-sell their wines, traveling to their 40 markets worldwide on a regular basis, and count many of their customers as friends. They form an unbeatable team bonded together by strong family roots, shared passion for winemaking, uncompromising search for excellence and dedication to their customers.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

The presentation of this special edition Six Grapes Old Vines Port pays homage to the original Six Grapes label that helped make the wine famous so many years ago. This wine will only be available in very limited quantities.Across the five Grahamâs estates we have preserved vineyards of old mixed vines, which are frequently more than forty years old. These beautiful, gnarled old vines produce immensely low yields of fruit, which grow in small, tight bunches with intense concentration and complexity.As would be expected from a wine made from such low yielding vines the Six Grapes Old Vines Port is deep purple in colour. It has complex floral aromas, redolent with rockrose, menthol and anise. The richness and opulent character of the wine is perfectly balanced by its refreshing acidity. It has great structure and concentration, with mineral notes that express the Douroâs schist soils, black plum and liquorice, all complemented by a lingering velvety smooth finish, the result of the ripe, fine grained tannins from these mature vines.Serve slightly chilled, between 16-18Â° C. There is no need to decant.The Six Grapes Old Vines Port is a perfect wine to pair with desserts such as cheese, dark chocolate or berry fruits. It is also ideally suited to drinking after dinner to fully appreciate its long finish and complexity.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Alba Dry Riesling,United States,na,New Jersey,Riesling,13.99,"Wine growing is all about site selection. Quality wine comes from prime vineyard sites.  Elevation, soil/air drainage, soil composition, and climate are all very important factors into cultivar selection.  Albaâs 93-acre estate is nestled in the rolling hills of Warren County, specifically on the north side of the Musconetcong river valley, a tributary of the Delaware river.  We are a part of the Warren Hills AVA where our vineyard rests between the elevations of 250â and 650â above sea level providing the farm with ample drainage of cold air; which helps to mitigate spring frosts and prolong our growing season. All of our vineyards blocks are on sloped terrain, varying from 5% to 30% grade, coupled with the southern exposure this provides our vines with all the sunlight exposure they could ever need.  This farm dates back to the late 1700âs, originally a dairy farm, our vineyards are the first cultivation of the land. This means the soils are as healthy as they can possible be and were never subject to years of other farming and depletion of nutrients.We believe in the value of vineyard ownership as a means of producing wines of exceptional quality, distinctive character, and consistency year after year. The ability to make autonomous decisions about the vineyard provides the winemaking team with a great amount of control and flexibility while ensuring the high quality care of the vines.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

Located in the heart of a wine-growing region, immersed in the splendid Monferrato hills. A history stretching half a century, marked by the passion for the vineyard, expert management of the wine cellar and the love for wine and sparkling wine. Today, the production department develops the firm with care throughout each phase: from the grape harvest to the bottling phase, which takes place on-site in the completely restructured wine cellar where innovation and technology unite giving life to products with a modern appearance but age-old heartIn 1958 they purchased and started a winery placed in Santo Stefano Belbo equipped for the production of sparkling and classic wines. The structures are improved, new clients are acquired, new markets open up and business is carried out abroad with great attention to market needs. In 1977 an up-to-date plant, the actual premises of the Company, was opened on an area of more than 18.000 square metres situated next to the birthplace of the writer Cesare Pavese. The factory does not process only the grapes grown at the 5 Santeroâs wine farms, but also the grapes bought from over three hundred local winegrowers.The production capacity of the winery is in excess of 18 million bottles per annum which is above all due to the strong presence of the main export markets.Santero has changed the packaging to modernity. In a static and traditional anchored segment, fixed on consolidated forms and images, it is necessary to begin with an innovative identity able to get itself noticed and be impressed without deceiving both accessibility codes and segment daily life in order to give style, elegance and the own brand contemporaneity to all the products. Great attention has been given to the bottle study giving distinctiveness and authority to the product; finally the use of Santero logo in relief increases value and quality to the whole product. Labels by particular shape and shading colours with attention both to every detail and to all particulars, both to the shadings and to the reflexions, give a touch of elegance to the whole bottle.Large areas grown with mono grape wine and a rich endowment of historical wine cellars dug into the tufa, of ancient farmhouse by elegant architectures, of medieval villages enhanced by churches and castles of a secular culture based on the wine production. Santero carries out its activity in a corner of Piemonte between Langhe and Monferrato: a wavy territory, lively and charming by the colour games gifts both by spontaneous plants and cultivations.

 Bread & Butter Pinot Noir,United States,na,California,Pinot Noir,11.99,"This is the BREAD.The use of wood barrels for wine began thousands of years ago for storage purposes, replacing clay vessels. Wood barrels were stronger and easier to move, but originally, they did not have a specific winemaking role.  Over time, it became apparent that aging wine in wood produced positive effects in the flavor, texture, and aroma of wine. Today, oak treatment is one of the most important tools in the winemaking process.Aging wine in oak barrels allows for moderate oxidation and evaporation of the wine, which lowers astringency and increases complexity and concentration in the wine. The complex chemical compounds in oak wood impart flavors and aromas to the wine that include toast, vanilla, tea, and nuttiness. These are flavors that we connect with bread or baked goods, like pie crust and biscuits.  If you can imagine the difference between a spoon full of jam vs. that same jam spread over a warm slice of toast, you can imagine how oak flavors and aromas can enhance the experience of a wine.Oak sources can be as specific as coming from a particular forest, but in general, we look to French oak for silkier textures and spicier characters.  Eastern European countries such as Hungary, Croatia, and Russia offer similar varieties of oak, but each source offers different results of spice, nuttiness, texture in the wine. We look to American oak for stronger influences of vanilla and coconut with creamier textures.  Bread & Butter Chardonnay and Pinot Noir are aged in a combination of French, American, and East European oak, ranging from new to 4 years old. We also utilize multiple cooperages, typically at a medium toast level, but continue to experiment with different oak sources, treatments, and technologies. Our goal is to continually improve enjoyment while maintaining an accessible price for our customers.  Much like a spice rack, the age of the oak, the type of oak, the level of toasting, the cooper, and even the way the wood was harvested or cut has an effect on the flavors and aromas in the wine.  None of that matters though if the wine is not delicious for the price that one pays, so as with all things, balance is the objective.Bread & Butter Riesling does not see any oak.This is the BUTTER.Malolactic fermentation, or MLF, is the process by which we convert malic acid to lactic acid. The process increases stability of the wine but it also takes harsh, tart malic acid (think green apples) and converts it to softer, richer lactic acid (think cream and butter).  The determining factors in buttery character are directly related to 3 key factors: type, temperature, and timing.Type: While some grapes are more likely to have naturally higher levels of malic acid, the type of climate in which they are grown is a stronger determining factor.  Grapes grown in cooler climates tend to have considerably higher levels of malic acid, while grapes grown in warmer climates have lower levels. Through the process of MFL, the amount of lactic acid produced is about half the amount of malic acid with which it began. For instance, if you start with 4 g/l of malic acid, after 100% MFL, the wine will have roughly 2 g/l of lactic acid.  A higher level of malic acid should convert to more lactic acid, thus producing more butter flavors and aromas.Temperature:  Similarly, the temperature at which we ferment the grapes will also affect the amount of buttery character in the wine. A higher temperature will produce less buttery character, while a cold fermentation will add a lot of butter flavor and aroma.Timing: When MFL is introduced has a major bearing on itâs effects on the wine.  The introduction of MFL during the primary fermentation of a wine will decrease the buttery character.  This is because the yeast that is feeding on sugar, starts feeding on the lactic acid that is being produced, which decreasing the lactic acid levels in the finished wine.  If that same wine undergoes MFL after the primary fermentation will have a higher level of lactic acid, and thus increased buttery characters.Bread & Butter Chardonnay and Pinot Noir are examples of wines that benefited from cool climate growing regions, cold fermentations, and post-primary fermentation MLF. Thus our wines present very smooth and rich, without harsh acids or sharp textures.  Bread & Butter Riesling sees no malolactic fermentation, but acid levels are balanced with sugar.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Peirano Estate Cabernet Sauvignon Lodi,United States,Central Valley,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,11.99,"The Early YearsIn 1879, with only fifty dollars in his pocket, Giacomo Peirano, a grape farmer from Genoa, Italy, immigrated to San Francisco, CA, in the hopes of fulfilling the American dream of striking it rich with gold during the historic Gold Rush age.  Soon realizing the days of really collecting a big share were no longer in sight, he decided to take whatever he had left of his fifty dollars and moved to Lodi, CA.At the time, Lodi was the home of many mining camps. Recognizing the excess of miners, yet the lack of merchants in the region, Giacomo, who was hungry and quickly running out money, scrounged up whatever cash he had left and opened up a mercantile store where miners could get all sorts of daily supplies and necessities.  The idea turned out to be an ingenious money maker and before he knew it, Giacomo was on a boat back to Italy to reunite with his adoring wife to be, Maria.  It was on this trip that he came across an idea which, unknown to him, would become the most important family jewel for centuries to come.  Along with his smitten bride, Giacomo brought with him Italian Zinfandel vine cuttings from his familys vineyard.   Upon his return to Lodi, he purchased 300 acres of land.  He proceeded to propagate and then plant the Zinfandel vines, creating one of the first vineyards in Lodi.  The vines expanded to cover seventy-five acres of the farmland.  Tending to them like they were his children, he spent long hours in the vineyards diligently working to     help the fruit reach its optimal level of ripeness.  He hand pruned and harvested every vine with precision care.  Quickly, caring for the grapes became a family affair.  Maria watched over the mercantile business, which helped to pay for the vineyards, while Giacomo was out in the fields with his five young sons Charles, William, George, Fred, and Frank.  This was the beginning of a family tradition that would last for generations to come. Family TragedyThe Peirano family had much to be thankful for. Their mercantile business was doing well, and the vineyards had grown to be a profitable venture, but the family was soon to endure the greatest pain they had ever experienced.  At the age of ten, Fred Peirano was kicked in the head by a horse and died as a result of his injuries.  Then, as if that was not enough, Frank died of blood poisoning at the age of twenty.  Giacomo and Maria were grief stricken and struggled to keep it together for the sake of their other three children.  To cope with their grief, they threw themselves into their mercantile and farming businesses. Giacomo and his remaining three sons diligently worked in the vineyards from morning till night while Maria occupied her mind with the shop. World War IAround 1914, after many years of devotion to an industry that earned him great respect, Giacomo Peirano hung up his farming hat and retired.  He passed down the 300 acres of land along with the mercantile business to his sons, Charlie, William, and George who carried on the family traditions with great pride. George and Charlie were the most involved with the vineyards, and William oversaw the mercantile business. Soon after, Charlie was called to fight in World War I from which he received a Purple Heart after becoming injured in the line of duty.  During this time, William and George held down the fort.  ProhibitionIn 1920, the government passed a law that would last for thirteen years prohibiting the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of alcohol across the majority of the states.  This era is infamously known as Prohibition.  For many grape farmers and winemakers, this turned into a financial disaster that they were never, fully, able to recover from.  For the Peirano family, this industry disaster resulted in advantageous conditions for their farming practice.  Since they were in the business of farming Zinfandel vines, which had yet to gain attention at the congressional level as a viable source for âwine grape production, the Peirano family bootlegged the fruit of their labor in mass quantities to Italian home winemakers in New York and Canada, providing added prosperity for almost a decade.The Great DepressionThough they were able to turn the era of Prohibition into a financial gain, a nationwide epidemic soon to follow did not treat them as kindly.  The Stock Market Crash of 1929, which notoriously resulted in the Great Depression, proved to be tough times for the Peirano family who suffered through the economic downturn like millions of other hardworking people worldwide.  There were times of starvation, fears of losing their land, and mounds of uncertainty about the future.  Eventually, with great determination and the help of World War II stimulating the economy, they were able to persevere and hold on to their land, making it through the most difficult financial period in Peirano family history.World War II                                                               Around this time, Charlotte, Charles daughter met a charming, young man, Randy Randolph, during a junior high school graduation dance.  They went to Lodi High together and became high school sweethearts.  Upon graduation, he joined the Air Force and was trained on the B-17, B-24, and B-29.  During basic training, he and Charlotte married.  She traveled with him to different Air Force academies, until he was sent off to World War II.  Upon his return, they moved to Tahoe and planned to purchase a sea plane and fly mail to and from Tahoe.  Everything changed when a friend of theirs, world famous World War II pilot, Tex Rankin, crashed and died en route to Charlotte and Randy flying their demo plane.  In wake of the catastrophe, they decided it was in the best interest of the family to halt plans for the flying service.  At this time, George was becoming gravely ill.  Charlotte and Randy moved back to Lodi and helped to run the vineyards.  In 1951, George passed away and Randy began learning the ins and outs of the business from Charles.  Eventually, Randy took over with the help of Charlotte, further continuing the family lineage in the vineyard business.  They would drag around their young son Lance, present day owner of Peirano Estate Vineyards, through the vineyards and began teaching him at the age of four the art of winemaking.  By the age of six, Lance was driving tractors, setting the stage for another great Peirano to harvest great winemaking grapes.Present DayIn 1992, Lance Randolph, the fourth generation of Peirano to farm the 300 acre estate, began making Peirano wine simply for himself and to prove Lodi could produce desirable wines.  After considerable praise for his ability to make elegant wines, he decided to start bottling and selling Peirano wine using his estate grown grapes.  Since then, Peirano has won numerous awards for producing top of the line wine using many of the old techniques valued by Giacomo Peirano.The history of Peirano Estate Vineyards is a tale deeply rooted in Lodi history and the importance is felt by every member of the Peirano family.  Legend has it that Lodi was named after Giacomos famous racer horse, Alta Genoa, he brought from Lodi, Italy. Over the years, the vineyards have grown to not only include the same naturally rooted, head trained Old Vine Zinfandel imported to the United States by Lances great grandfather, but Cabernet Sauvignon, Viogner, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Muscat Canelli, Merlot, Shiraz, Tempranillo, Petite Sirah, Barbera, Syrah and  Malbec as well.  The difficult times in the Peirano family history, did prove to be challenging but showed their tenacity through desperation and hard times.  How, you might ask, were they able to persevere?  As Lance Randolph says, âA family that works together stays together, and the vineyards are a big part of our family.  Its as simple as that!",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Hidalgo Jerez Oloroso Gobernador,Spain,Manzanilla Sanlucar de Barrame,Jerez - Xeres - Sherry,Palomino,24.99,"Founded in 1792 by Jose Pantaleon Hidalgo, Bodegas Hidalgo is owned by the sixth successive generation of the family. Hidalgo is a modern rarity, being the last remaining family business (and almacenista, for those familiar with this term) to produce and export its own unblended, single-solera Sherries.Just as rare is Bodegas Hidalgoâs total reliance on its own vineyards, 500 acres of Palomino Fino located in the great chalk pagos (âcrusâ) of Balbaina - the closest Jerez vineyard to the sea - and Miraflores, the great Sanlucar vineyard renowned for the pedigree of its wines. Just as significant is the privileged location of the familyâs Bodega San Luis - at beach-level in Sanlucar de Barrameda, where the Guadalquivir River meets the ocean. Here, the miracle of Manzanilla is made possible by constant exposure to Atlantic breezes, laden with moisture and an ambient yeast/algae culture called flor. This surface-growing culture thrives year-round along Sanlucarâs southwest-facing beachfront, protecting the resting wines from exposure to the air. At the same time, flor imparts the bracing, briny smell of sea spray which is Manzanillaâs hallmark, reflecting its years-long maturation process within earshot of the waves.La Gitana Manzanilla (âthe gypsyâ), is Hidalgoâs flagship wine, product of a family solera established in the early 19th century, around the same time Manzanilla as a wine type came into existence. La Gitana is regarded as the authoritative Manzanilla in Spain and abroad.Pastrana Manzanilla Pasada: To the southeast of Sanlucar lies a chalk dune overlooking the Atlantic which offers the perfect conditions for ripening the Palomino grape and for production of the regionâs finest dry wines. This is Miraflores, the Grand Cru of Jerez Superior. Hidalgoâs ancestral Pastrana site, a monopole holding, is at the heart of Miraflores. Pastrana contributes the length and finesse, perhaps even the soul, in all of Hidalgoâs magnificent wines, and a decision was taken some years back to market small quantities of the most exemplary manzanilla from this superlative vineyard on its own.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Charles Smith Chateau Smith Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Columbia Valley,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,16.99,"Growing up just outside of Sacramento, California, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Charles Smith began craving worldly travel at a young age due to his Welsh mother and French father. As soon as he had the chance, Charles decided to move to Denmark (for a âhot piece of a** i.e. a lady friend he met in the states). While in Scandinavia, Charles spent the next nine years managing rock bands and concert tours throughout Europe, including the famed Danish duo, The Ravonettes. Wining and dining while on the road became a catalyst for his passion of wine, which ultimately triggered the career he has today.In 1999, he moved back to the United States, specifically to the Pacific Northwest, opening a wine shop on Bainbridge Island, just across the Puget Sound from downtown Seattle. On a road trip in late 1999, he passed through the small town of Walla Walla and met a young Frenchman and winemaker. The two men discovered their common passion for great Syrah and Charles was eventually convinced to move to Walla Walla and make his own juice. In 2001, Charles released 330 cases of his first wine, the 1999 K Syrah. The Walla Walla Valley was now his home.After a devastating freeze in 2004, Charles brought to life a label he had once in a dream: House Wine. Low and behold, the label concept had never been created or trademarked, so Charles launched the legendary brand before selling it to Precept Brands in 2006. That same year, Charles started a second brand, Charles Smith Wines. The brand was themed as âThe Modernist Project, which focuses on the way people generally consume wine today: immediately. The intent was (and still is) to create wines to be enjoyed now, but with true typicity of both the varietal and the vineyard.A self-taught winemaker, Charles is a true artisan and a pioneer in the wine world.

A history stretching half a century, marked by the passion for the vineyard, expert management of the wine cellar and the love for wine and sparkling wine. Today, the production department develops the firm with care throughout each phase: from the grape harvest to the bottling phase, which takes place on-site in the completely restructured wine cellar where innovation and technology unite giving life to products with a modern appearance but age-old heartIn 1958 they purchased and started a winery placed in Santo Stefano Belbo equipped for the production of sparkling and classic wines. The structures are improved, new clients are acquired, new markets open up and business is carried out abroad with great attention to market needs. In 1977 an up-to-date plant, the actual premises of the Company, was opened on an area of more than 18.000 square metres situated next to the birthplace of the writer Cesare Pavese. The factory does not process only the grapes grown at the 5 Santeroâs wine farms, but also the grapes bought from over three hundred local winegrowers.The production capacity of the winery is in excess of 18 million bottles per annum which is above all due to the strong presence of the main export markets.Santero has changed the packaging to modernity. In a static and traditional anchored segment, fixed on consolidated forms and images, it is necessary to begin with an innovative identity able to get itself noticed and be impressed without deceiving both accessibility codes and segment daily life in order to give style, elegance and the own brand contemporaneity to all the products. Great attention has been given to the bottle study giving distinctiveness and authority to the product; finally the use of Santero logo in relief increases value and quality to the whole product. Labels by particular shape and shading colours with attention both to every detail and to all particulars, both to the shadings and to the reflexions, give a touch of elegance to the whole bottle.Large areas grown with mono grape wine and a rich endowment of historical wine cellars dug into the tufa, of ancient farmhouse by elegant architectures, of medieval villages enhanced by churches and castles of a secular culture based on the wine production. Santero carries out its activity in a corner of Piemonte between Langhe and Monferrato: a wavy territory, lively and charming by the colour games gifts both by spontaneous plants and cultivations. Quality is not a myth of communication, but a concrete fact. In Santo Stefano Belbo Santero lives in strong contact with agriculture world that characterizes its tradition of historic wine company. Seasonal rhythms and nature, living together between man and environment: it is the ancient but immutable dimension living in the heart of Langa vocation wine sector.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

The Garden series faithfully represents individual growing regions in the aggregate sense, with clear distinctions that can be made between, for example, Eden Valley and Barossa Valley, but extending to the differences between Clare, McLaren Vale, Adelaide Hills and Heathcote. Moving up the quality ladder, the single-vineyard wines showcase individual (dare I say?) terroirs, several within Barossa itself.

 Folie A Deux Sonoma Country Pinot Noir,United States,Sonoma County,California,Pinot Noir,19.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the worldâs leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Marioâs son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his familyâs efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a âstuckâ fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Homeâs original philosophy to offer âa great product for a fair price,â even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Ironside Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,na,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,14.99,"WEâLL ADMIT IT, WE LOVE GREAT WINEâ¦Thatâs why we started Ninety+ Cellars.It all started in the spring of 2009. Armed with a copy of the latest Wine Spectator, founder Kevin Mehra set out on a mission to bring higher quality wine to the market for a better price. He started calling wineries with a history of high ratings to ask if they had extra wine for sale. Some told him to get lost, but in the end, he found a handful of wineries that liked his concept. The plan was simple: we put their wine in our bottle, and sell it for less.But why would wineries want to do that?You may recall that the economy wasnât in the best shape in 2009. Demand for wines priced more than $20 a bottle had plummeted and inventories were piling up. Rather than discount their wine and erode the value of their brand, we found that wineries were willing to part with a certain percentage of their production for a reduced price.It was a win/win scenario. Wineries got to sell more wine, and consumers got access to better wine at lower prices.The landscape has changed quite a bit since we launched; but our mission and our ability to offer great wine has not. With our head wine buyer, Brett Vankoski, at the helm we continue to seek out the best opportunities in the market and turn those into great values in the bottle for you.

 Bodega Noemia de Patagonia A Lisa Malbec,Argentina,Rio Negro,Southern Region,Malbec,16.99,"The Bodega Noemia de Patagonia project began with the discovery and restoration of an ancient vineyard, hidden among a cluster of poplars surrounding this small vineyard. This old vineyard was planted with Malbec grapes in the 1930s in a remote corner of the Rio Negro valley. It was quite a feat to reach such a hidden place; 620 miles south of Buenos Aires, 280 miles to the east of the Andes, 310 miles west of the Atlantic coast or 1240 miles from Tierra del Fuego.The project partners, famous Italian wine producer Countess Noemi Marone Cinzano and Danish winemaker Hans Vinding-Diers, fell in love with the place and decided to restore it and return it to its original condition.After buying the grapes from this semi-abandoned vineyard in 2001, their first vintage was made in an old shed belonging to a fruit packing company; they destemmed the grapes by hand at night, and put them in open fibreglass tanks so that they could crush them with their feet. The idea was to get back to basics.In 2004, Noemi and Hans decided to buy that same vineyard and have continued the project to this day with the same passion with which they started it.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"
 e Guigal Saint-Joseph Blanc,France,Northern Rhone,Rhone,White Rhone Blend,24.99,"Not many wine lovers realize just how important white wines are at Guigal, where 25% of total production is in white. By contrast only 2% of total production in the Rhone valley is white wines. Perhaps even more impressive, this family-owned and -operated domain is responsible for almost a third of the total production of Condrieu. And a reliably excellent Condrieu it is, as is the high-end La Doriane bottling, which in many vintages is one the very best bottlings made from the appellation. Philippe Guigal admits that he has a bit of an obsession with white Hermitage and heâs especially fussy about the luxe Ex-Voto bottling, a wine that he only bottles in exceptional vintages like 2015. The 2013 version, by the way, is still painfully young, but based on the bottle I drank last month itâs a genuine cellar treasure and, in the context of world-class white wines, a relative bargain that should easily reach its 30th birthday if well cellared.From 2016 Northern Rhone Whites: Excellent but Often Scarce (May 2018) by Josh Raynolds",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Airfield Estates Runway Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,Columbia Valley,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,16.99,"As the name suggests, our family estate has historical ties to aviation! To find out more about the WWII airbase that resided on our property, see the sections below:The official story:Just prior to the United States entry into World War II, the Olympic Air Transport Company contacted our founder, H. Lloyd Miller, about the possibility of leasing land from him for a period of a few years in order to build an airbase to train military pilots. Lloyd, a successful realtor and landowner, knew it would be several years before the arrival of Roza irrigation water so he agreed to lease out his property.Construction of the airbase commenced in the latter part of 1941. The buildings erected on the site included a 70 foot water tower, several airplane hangars, a mess hall, barracks, and several smaller storage buildings. Three dirt runways were also formed, each of which was over a half mile long. The pilots trained primarily on bi-winged Stearman Airplanes.The airbase continued operations until the mid 1940âs. Shortly after WWII came to an end, the pilots moved off site and the recently constructed buildings were auctioned off to the highest bidder. The only bidder turned out to be H. Lloyd Miller, and it is said that he got one heck of a deal on all the buildings. These unique buildings became the headquarters of the Miller familyâs farming operations up to today. Over time, many of the buildings began to deteriorate, but two of the original hangars still exist and we continue to use them as workshop and storage facilities.The rumors: The unofficial story is that the military airbase had ulterior motives. It was not just designed for training pilots. During the war years, there were six small airbases that made a horseshoe pattern around Hanford Reach. These bases were located near Moxee, Ephrata, Connell, Othello, Richland, and âAirfieldâsâ base in Sunnyside. These bases were strategically located around Hanford Reach in order to conduct surveillance over the highly classified Hanford Nuclear Reservation that was refining plutonium for the atomic bombs that would eventually be dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. The airbase also provided potential defense if we came under attack because the runways were long enough to allow for the landing of larger fighter and attack aircrafts.

 Dry Creek The Mariner Red Meritage,United States,Sonoma County,California,Bordeaux Blend,34.99,"The history of Dry Creek Vineyard is a long and colorful one. Founded in 1972 by David S. Stare, Dry Creek Vineyard paved the way for a renaissance of winemaking and viticulture in the Dry Creek Valley. Before his arrival, the Dry Creek Valley was little more than a few family farms and prune orchards. It was Daveâs vision to start a Loire Valley inspired winery, which triggered a viticultural reawakening in northern Sonoma County.Without a doubt, David Stare is a pioneer. Heading west in the late 1960s, he personified the character and work ethic of early Gold Rush pioneers. Educated at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Dave worked for the B&O Railroad for several years but quickly realized that his true calling was in the wine industry. Inspired by his trips to the Loire Valley, he headed west to California to start his own family winery.Upon his arrival, Dave began taking winemaking classes at UC Davis as a graduate student. On the weekends, he spent time looking at vineyard land from Monterey to Mendocino. It was during one of those weekend trips that fate drew Dave to the Dry Creek Valley. When he saw an old prune orchard across the street from the Dry Creek General Store, Dave realized that he had found his dream location. He purchased the orchard and began planting vines. Captivated by his memories of Loire-style wines, Sauvignon Blanc seemed destined to figure prominently in the Dry Creek Vineyard portfolio. However, several famed vineyard specialists advised him against planting Sauvignon Blanc. Always looking to push the envelope, Dave planted the varietal anyway and the rest is history.Today, our second-generation family owned winery continues to evolve and grow to meet the demands of a global wine marketplace. The primary mission of our winery is to produce distinctive wines that overdeliver on quality. For more than 40 years, this pursuit of winemaking excellence has led to many international awards and accolades. With a loyal following of wine club members and customers, the future of Dry Creek Vineyard has never been brighter.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

" Peirano White "" The Other """,United States,Central Valley,California,Non-Varietal White Blend,6.98,"The Early YearsIn 1879, with only fifty dollars in his pocket, Giacomo Peirano, a grape farmer from Genoa, Italy, immigrated to San Francisco, CA, in the hopes of fulfilling the American dream of striking it rich with gold during the historic Gold Rush age.  Soon realizing the days of really collecting a big share were no longer in sight, he decided to take whatever he had left of his fifty dollars and moved to Lodi, CA.At the time, Lodi was the home of many mining camps. Recognizing the excess of miners, yet the lack of merchants in the region, Giacomo, who was hungry and quickly running out money, scrounged up whatever cash he had left and opened up a mercantile store where miners could get all sorts of daily supplies and necessities.  The idea turned out to be an ingenious money maker and before he knew it, Giacomo was on a boat back to Italy to reunite with his adoring wife to be, Maria.  It was on this trip that he came across an idea which, unknown to him, would become the most important family jewel for centuries to come.  Along with his smitten bride, Giacomo brought with him Italian Zinfandel vine cuttings from his familys vineyard.   Upon his return to Lodi, he purchased 300 acres of land.  He proceeded to propagate and then plant the Zinfandel vines, creating one of the first vineyards in Lodi.  The vines expanded to cover seventy-five acres of the farmland.  Tending to them like they were his children, he spent long hours in the vineyards diligently working to     help the fruit reach its optimal level of ripeness.  He hand pruned and harvested every vine with precision care.  Quickly, caring for the grapes became a family affair.  Maria watched over the mercantile business, which helped to pay for the vineyards, while Giacomo was out in the fields with his five young sons Charles, William, George, Fred, and Frank.  This was the beginning of a family tradition that would last for generations to come. Family TragedyThe Peirano family had much to be thankful for. Their mercantile business was doing well, and the vineyards had grown to be a profitable venture, but the family was soon to endure the greatest pain they had ever experienced.  At the age of ten, Fred Peirano was kicked in the head by a horse and died as a result of his injuries.  Then, as if that was not enough, Frank died of blood poisoning at the age of twenty.  Giacomo and Maria were grief stricken and struggled to keep it together for the sake of their other three children.  To cope with their grief, they threw themselves into their mercantile and farming businesses. Giacomo and his remaining three sons diligently worked in the vineyards from morning till night while Maria occupied her mind with the shop. World War IAround 1914, after many years of devotion to an industry that earned him great respect, Giacomo Peirano hung up his farming hat and retired.  He passed down the 300 acres of land along with the mercantile business to his sons, Charlie, William, and George who carried on the family traditions with great pride. George and Charlie were the most involved with the vineyards, and William oversaw the mercantile business. Soon after, Charlie was called to fight in World War I from which he received a Purple Heart after becoming injured in the line of duty.  During this time, William and George held down the fort.  ProhibitionIn 1920, the government passed a law that would last for thirteen years prohibiting the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of alcohol across the majority of the states.  This era is infamously known as Prohibition.  For many grape farmers and winemakers, this turned into a financial disaster that they were never, fully, able to recover from.  For the Peirano family, this industry disaster resulted in advantageous conditions for their farming practice.  Since they were in the business of farming Zinfandel vines, which had yet to gain attention at the congressional level as a viable source for âwine grape production, the Peirano family bootlegged the fruit of their labor in mass quantities to Italian home winemakers in New York and Canada, providing added prosperity for almost a decade.The Great DepressionThough they were able to turn the era of Prohibition into a financial gain, a nationwide epidemic soon to follow did not treat them as kindly.  The Stock Market Crash of 1929, which notoriously resulted in the Great Depression, proved to be tough times for the Peirano family who suffered through the economic downturn like millions of other hardworking people worldwide.  There were times of starvation, fears of losing their land, and mounds of uncertainty about the future.  Eventually, with great determination and the help of World War II stimulating the economy, they were able to persevere and hold on to their land, making it through the most difficult financial period in Peirano family history.World War II                                                               Around this time, Charlotte, Charles daughter met a charming, young man, Randy Randolph, during a junior high school graduation dance.  They went to Lodi High together and became high school sweethearts.  Upon graduation, he joined the Air Force and was trained on the B-17, B-24, and B-29.  During basic training, he and Charlotte married.  She traveled with him to different Air Force academies, until he was sent off to World War II.  Upon his return, they moved to Tahoe and planned to purchase a sea plane and fly mail to and from Tahoe.  Everything changed when a friend of theirs, world famous World War II pilot, Tex Rankin, crashed and died en route to Charlotte and Randy flying their demo plane.  In wake of the catastrophe, they decided it was in the best interest of the family to halt plans for the flying service.  At this time, George was becoming gravely ill.  Charlotte and Randy moved back to Lodi and helped to run the vineyards.  In 1951, George passed away and Randy began learning the ins and outs of the business from Charles.  Eventually, Randy took over with the help of Charlotte, further continuing the family lineage in the vineyard business.  They would drag around their young son Lance, present day owner of Peirano Estate Vineyards, through the vineyards and began teaching him at the age of four the art of winemaking.  By the age of six, Lance was driving tractors, setting the stage for another great Peirano to harvest great winemaking grapes.Present DayIn 1992, Lance Randolph, the fourth generation of Peirano to farm the 300 acre estate, began making Peirano wine simply for himself and to prove Lodi could produce desirable wines.  After considerable praise for his ability to make elegant wines, he decided to start bottling and selling Peirano wine using his estate grown grapes.  Since then, Peirano has won numerous awards for producing top of the line wine using many of the old techniques valued by Giacomo Peirano.The history of Peirano Estate Vineyards is a tale deeply rooted in Lodi history and the importance is felt by every member of the Peirano family.  Legend has it that Lodi was named after Giacomos famous racer horse, Alta Genoa, he brought from Lodi, Italy. Over the years, the vineyards have grown to not only include the same naturally rooted, head trained Old Vine Zinfandel imported to the United States by Lances great grandfather, but Cabernet Sauvignon, Viogner, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Muscat Canelli, Merlot, Shiraz, Tempranillo, Petite Sirah, Barbera, Syrah and  Malbec as well.  The difficult times in the Peirano family history, did prove to be challenging but showed their tenacity through desperation and hard times.  How, you might ask, were they able to persevere?  As Lance Randolph says, âA family that works together stays together, and the vineyards are a big part of our family.  Its as simple as that!",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

In 1880, Andrea I sold the small vineyards in the island and bought 150 acres of virgin land in the north of Tunisia - precisely at Khanguet Gare, in the region of Cape Bon. There were planted and picked the first grapes then, in the early years of the XXth century, Andrea I and his son Giovanni began to produce quality wines in their family cellar. Such a good wine that from the port of Tunis departed full-loaded cargos to serve the best markets of France.In 1938 Andrea II, son of Giovanni, was only sixteen when he took the business in his hands and continued to rise the fame and quality of the wines with courage and toil. But a terrible illness striked Tunisia destroying all the vineyards: Filossera. The dry grapes were burned and the obtained coal was sold in the market of Tunis.The family got new plants of innested barbatelle resisting to the disease from France and the red and desolate lands began to colour up again with green leaves and generous grapes.On May 12th, in 1964, Habib Bourguiba - the current president of Tunisia at that time - with an historically important measure dispossessed all the goods and properties of the foreigners in Tunisia.Suddently a life-time hard work and sacrifice was wiped out and the Pandolfo family had to leave the country and divide between Italy and France. Andrea II at that time was fourty-two years old and, with his wife Elena and his sons, decided to come back to Italy to buy a small estate close to Terracina in Via Renibbio nÂ° 1720 where he re-started to till that bitter-sweet land and to harvest, during the vintage of 1968, the first grapes to make wine.With the first customers, the first bottles with hand-written labels and the first chestnut barrels the family cellar started to set up in the early wine-producing realities of the Pontina region. In 1976 Andrea II Pandolfo died and his sons, sided by the help of their mother Elena, decided to carry on that dream which began 150 years before by Andrea I in Pantelleria island.This is how the farm âSantâAndreaâ was born, also to remember the name of its founder.

 Sutter Home  Sangria,United States,na,California,Non-Varietal Red Blend,6.99,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the worldâs leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Marioâs son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his familyâs efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes.

After drawing off, the wine is transferred into small 225-litre barrels for the malolactic fermentation and a period of ageing that can last between 15 and 20 months.

The philosophy of the Domaine is to work early and intensively in the vineyard. Using no pesticides for over 20 years, the family ploughs the soil to control the weeds, while encouraging the roots to dig deeper.Shoots are thinned before bud-break for a naturally low yield that prevents the need for green harvesting, and leaves are thinned several times to attain good aeration and sunlight for the clusters. Grass is encouraged to grow between the rows to stimulate microbial activity that drastically limits the need for treatment of the vines. The result is maximum expression of âterroirâ.With only perfectly ripe bunches, hand-cut from the vine, vinification takes place in a modern winery and ageing occurs in only the best oak barrels that are up to three years old. Employing a traditional winemaking process, all of Roger and Julieâs wines are spectacular and rare.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

The selection set out to produce a wine that could measure itself against the more structured Piedmontese reds, and deal confidently with decidedly long periods of ageing without forfeiting the elegance that is typical of the Nebbiolos originating on the steep slopes of the Roero. Here, on the limy, east-facing soil of Frailin hill, the grapes can benefit from dry, hot summer days, as well as enjoying the last lingering lukewarm rays of the setting sun in autumn: something which is often forgotten as being essential for a late-ripening variety such as Nebbiolo. Grown following traditional local mthods, the grapes are picked in the middle of October. The fermentation is always long and slow so as to allow all the natural ingredients contained in the grapes to develop in the wine. It is then drawn off into different fill barrels, where it completes its malolactic fermentation and remains for at least 24 months. After a further year of maturing in the peace and quiet of our old cellars, the wine is bottled in preparation for its release. With its expansive, fruity nose, followed by length and body on the mouth, though the taste is dominated by the elegance of Roero tannins, it will continue to improve with lengthy aging in the bottle.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Sycamore Lane White Zinfandel,United States,na,California,Zinfandel,4.69,"At Trinchero Family Estates, our passion for winemaking and delivering the most inspiring flavors from around the globe began more than 60 years ago. In 1947, brothers John and Mario Trinchero traveled to St. Helena, California, near the renowned Napa Valley growing region, and purchased Sutter Home Winery. With its first Sutter Home harvest in 1948, the Trinchero Family crushed three tons of grapes, beginning a long and fruitful history as one of the worldâs leading producers of fine wines.As the Trinchero family expanded, so too did the company. Marioâs son Bob joined the team in 1958, eventually becoming the head winemaker after his uncle John retired. Bob focused on growing his familyâs efforts, and just 10 years after coming on board, he helped Sutter Home become the first north coast winery to produce commercial wine from Sierra Foothill grapes. He even developed the revolutionary White Zinfandel varietal, which he perfected through innovation, creativity, and a bit of luck in suffering through a âstuckâ fermentation in 1975. With the help of his brother Roger, his wife Evelyn, and his sister Vera, Bob was able to capitalize on the growing demand for White Zinfandel and expand Sutter Home even further.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Trinchero family continued its efforts to produce high-quality, affordably priced varietal wines by purchasing several more California vineyards in areas with choice weather and soil conditions. The family has never lost sight of Sutter Homeâs original philosophy to offer âa great product for a fair price,â even as it acquired more vineyards and additional wineries.Today, with Roger Trinchero leading the way, Trinchero Family Estates represents over 27 brands in the United States and Australia, including Sutter Home, Little Boomey, Menage a Trois, Napa Cellars, and Trinchero Napa Valley. Sutter Home is also the proud sponsor of the Build a Better Burger contest, which pits culinary contestants in an annual burger cookoff to win cash prizes and bragging rites. In all, the last 60 years have been a period of heavy growth and exciting innovation for the Trinchero family, and we look forward to enjoying many more successful years to come.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"

 Joseph Drouhin Puligny Montrachet,France,Cote de Beaune,Burgundy,Chardonnay,64.99,"Winemaker Jerome Faure-Brac wasnât wild for the sun-drenched 2015s at the beginning owing to their deficit of acidity (none of the finished wines have as much as 4 grams per liter). But the wines didnât change much during the secondary fermentations due to the lack of malic acidity. The lees were also very clean so Faure-Brac kept as much of them as possible, which he believes contributed to the ultimate freshness of the wines. They finished tactile and saline, with some evidence of tannins. âItâs rare that we have such a combination of richness and tension,â said Faure-Brac, âand of course itâs an amazing vintage for the reds.â",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"
 90+ Cellars Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon Lot 94,United States,Napa County,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,24.99,"WEâLL ADMIT IT, WE LOVE GREAT WINEâ¦Thatâs why we started Ninety+ Cellars.It all started in the spring of 2009. Armed with a copy of the latest Wine Spectator, founder Kevin Mehra set out on a mission to bring higher quality wine to the market for a better price. He started calling wineries with a history of high ratings to ask if they had extra wine for sale. Some told him to get lost, but in the end, he found a handful of wineries that liked his concept. The plan was simple: we put their wine in our bottle, and sell it for less.But why would wineries want to do that?You may recall that the economy wasnât in the best shape in 2009. Demand for wines priced more than $20 a bottle had plummeted and inventories were piling up. Rather than discount their wine and erode the value of their brand, we found that wineries were willing to part with a certain percentage of their production for a reduced price.It was a win/win scenario. Wineries got to sell more wine, and consumers got access to better wine at lower prices.The landscape has changed quite a bit since we launched; but our mission and our ability to offer great wine has not. With our head wine buyer, Brett Vankoski, at the helm we continue to seek out the best opportunities in the market and turn those into great values in the bottle for you. We do this because we love great wine, and we know you do too.",Petrocks Liquors,"419 Amwell Road Hillsborough, NJ 08844"
 Lockhart Cabernet Sauvignon,United States,na,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,11.99,"Lockhart was inspired by the intersection of opportunity and creativity. Inspired and in collaboration with T. Edward Wines, these expressions of Chardonnay, Cabernet & Merlot over deliver for their price point. The wines of Lockhart are a testament to our relationships with growers and vintners in the Valley and beyond.Lockhart Wines are produced with a clear goal: to make straight-forward, food-friendly wines. This goal is attained through a process that begins in the vineyard, where high-quality grapes provide a base for the wine. The grapes chosen for these wines are from select vineyard sites in Sonoma and Napa counties.The winemaking style is one of little intervention. No new oak is used (none at all in the Chardonnay) to allow the fruit and varietal characteristics of the wines to shine through.

Francesco wanted to do something different, turn traditional wine into a groundbreaking new product. With Luigi Bosca, wine magician Francesco worked out his idea in Canelli in Piemonte, Italy. An area where many muscat grapes are grown, for instance for the Asti Spumante. There arose the idea of creating an accessible wine that would be so fresh and bubbly, that people from all over the world would love. He took the muscat grape as a base and added natural aromaâs and a light bubble. The result: a Frizzante wine with a low alcohol percentage, a subtle bubble and a delicate sweet taste.
